",composite,0
91_Q2,"
To determine if 91 is a prime number, we can check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we know that 91 is divisible by 1. 
Now, let's check if it is divisible by any other number. We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. Since 2 does not evenly divide into 91 (91 ÷ 2 = 45 remainder 1), we can conclude that 91 is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we sum the digits of 91 which is 9 + 1 = 10, and if 10 is divisible by 3, then 91 is also divisible by 3. However, 10 is not divisible by 3, so we can conclude that 91 is not divisible by 3.

Since we have checked divisibility by 2 and 3, two of the divisors of 91, and found that it is not evenly divisible by either, we can conclude that 91 is a prime number.

To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

For number 65, we can start by dividing it by 2, which is the smallest prime number. Since 65 is not divisible evenly by 2 (as 65/2 = 32.5 which is not a whole number), we can conclude that 65 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can try dividing 65 by 3. Again, 65 is not divisible evenly by 3 (as 65/3 = 21.6666... which is not a whole number).

With this process, we continue checking divisibility up to the square root of 65 (approximately 8.06). Checking divisibility by numbers beyond this point is not necessary since any factors of 65 must be smaller than its square root.

Continuing this method, we find that 65 is divisible by 5, as 65/5 = 13 (which is a whole number). Therefore, 65 is not a prime number.

To summarize, 65 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 5.

To determine if 84 is composite, we look for its factors. Factors are the numbers that divide evenly into a given number.

The factors of 84 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42, and 84.

Since 84 has more than two distinct positive divisors (1 and itself), such as 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42, it is a composite number.

Therefore, 84 is a composite number.

For 46, we can find factors by dividing it by numbers from 2 to its square root (inclusive). 

46 divided by 2 gives us a quotient of 23. 

46 divided by 3 is not an integer, which means 3 is not a factor of 46. 

46 divided by 4 is not an integer. 

Similarly, dividing 46 by 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 does not give us integers. 

However, when we divide 46 by 10, we get a quotient of 4.6, which means 10 is a factor of 46. 

Therefore, 46 has factors other than 1 and itself, making it a composite number.

",composite,0
24_Q2,"
To determine if 24 is a prime number, we need to check whether it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check if 24 is divisible by 2. Since 24 can be divided evenly by 2 (24 ÷ 2 = 12), 24 is not a prime number.

Step 2: We do not need to check other numbers because if a number is divisible by 2, it will also be divisible by any multiple of 2 (4, 6, 8, 10, etc.).

Therefore, 24 is not a prime number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.

So, 2 is a factor of 24. 

24 divided by 3 equals 8 
So, 3 is also a factor of 24. 

24 divided by 4 equals 6 
So, 4 is yet another factor of 24. 

Apart from 1 and 24, which are always factors of any number, we found that 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 are also factors of 24. 

Since 24 has factors other than 1 and itself, it is classified as a composite number.

To determine if 51 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we note that 51 is divisible by 3, because the sum of its digits (5 + 1) equals 6, which is divisible by 3. 

We can also verify this by division: 

51 divided by 3 equals 17. 

Since 51 has divisors other than 1 and itself (3 and 17), it is not a prime number.

Next, we try dividing 51 by 3. 51 divided by 3 equals 17, which is a whole number. 

Since 17 is a prime number, and we have exhausted all other possibilities, we can conclude that 51 only has factors 1 and 51. 

Therefore, 51 is not a composite number but rather a prime number.

1. Start by checking if 11 is divisible by any number less than itself. 
2. The smallest prime number greater than 1 is 2. So, check if 11 is divisible by 2. Since 11 is not an even number, it is not divisible by 2.
3. Next, check if 11 is divisible by any odd number greater than 2, up to the square root of 11 (approximately 3.32). That means we can check divisibility by 3 and 5 as the next odd numbers.
4. 11 is not divisible by 3, as 3 does not divide evenly into 11.
5. 11 is also not divisible by 5, as 5 does not divide evenly into 11.

Next, we can check if 17 is divisible by 3. Similarly, 17 is not divisible by 3.

We continue this process, checking divisibility by progressively larger prime numbers. Checking divisibility by 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on, we find that none of these numbers evenly divide 17.

Therefore, we can conclude that 17 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 17, with no other factors.

To determine if 19 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. Since 19 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we add the individual digits of 19 (1 + 9 = 10) and check if the sum is divisible by 3. Since 10 is not divisible by 3, 19 is also not divisible by 3.

Continuing this process, we can check if 19 is divisible by 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. However, we can already conclude that 19 is a prime number because it is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

Step 2: Count the number of factors
Since there are only two factors (1 and 23) and no other numbers, we can conclude that 23 is only divisible by 1 and itself.

Step 3: Determine if it is a composite number
A composite number is defined as a number greater than 1 that has more than two factors. Since 23 has only two factors (1 and 23), it satisfies the definition of a prime number, not a composite number.

Therefore, we can conclude that 23 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.

Let's calculate the square root of 29: √29 ≈ 5.385

Now we can check if 29 is divisible by any numbers between 2 and 5. Since 29 is not divisible by 2, 3, 4, or 5, we can conclude that 29 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Starting with 2, we see that 37 divided by 2 gives us a quotient of 18 with a remainder of 1. Since 1 is not equal to 0, we can conclude that 37 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can try dividing 37 by 3. The quotient is approximately 12.33, and there is a remainder of 1. Again, since the remainder is not 0, 37 is not divisible by 3.

Testing for divisibility by 4, 5, and 6 is not necessary since the result would still be a non-zero remainder.

Continuing this process, we find that 37 is not divisible by any numbers up to 6.

Therefore, we can conclude that 37 is a prime number since it is only divisible by 1 and itself.

Now, we need to check if any number between 2 and 6 evenly divides 37. 

By testing each number individually, we find that none of the numbers between 2 and 6 evenly divides 37.

To determine whether 395 is a composite number or not, we need to check if it can be divided evenly by any number other than 1 and itself.

We start by checking if 395 is divisible by 2. 395 is an odd number, and since it does not end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check if 395 is divisible by 3. We add the digits of 395 (3 + 9 + 5 = 17) and check if this sum is divisible by 3. Since 17 is not divisible by 3, 395 is not divisible by 3 either.

Now, we check if 395 is divisible by 5. Since 395 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Lastly, we check if 395 is divisible by 7. We can use the following trick: subtract twice the last digit (5) from the number formed by the rest of the digits (39): 39 - 2*5 = 39 - 10 = 29. Since 29 is not divisible by 7, 395 is not divisible by 7 either.

Since we have checked the prime numbers up to the square root of 395 (2, 3, 5, and 7), and none of them divide evenly into 395, we can conclude that 395 is a prime number.

To determine if 538 is a prime number, we can first check if it is divisible by any prime number less than its square root (which is approximately 23.2). 

Starting with the smallest prime number, 2, we see that 538 is even but not divisible by 2, as the last digit is not divisible by 2.

Next, we move to the next prime number, 3. Adding the digits of 538 (5 + 3 + 8 = 16), we see that 538 is not divisible by 3.

Now, let's check if it is divisible by 5. Since 538 does not end with 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

We continue to check if 538 is divisible by prime numbers greater than 5, such as 7, 11, 13, and so on. However, we find that none of these prime numbers divide evenly into 538.

Therefore, we can conclude that 538 is not a prime number since it is divisible by 2 and 7.

To determine if 538 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

One way to check is to divide 538 by prime numbers starting from 2 until the square root of 538.

Let's do this:

Starting from 2, we divide 538 by each prime number (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23) until we reach a number greater than the square root of 538.

538 ÷ 2 = 269 (not divisible)

Since we've reached a number greater than the square root of 538 (23.391 > 23.18), we can conclude that there are no factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 538 is a prime number.

To determine if 134 is a prime number, we should check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2.
134 divided by 2 equals 67, which is not a whole number.
Since 2 does not divide 134 evenly, we can conclude that 134 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3.
The sum of the digits of 134 is 1 + 3 + 4 = 8, which is not divisible by 3.
Therefore, 134 is not divisible by 3.

We can now proceed to check if it is divisible by any numbers up to its square root, which is approximately 11.6. 
By testing numbers 5, 7, 11, we will observe that none of them divide 134 evenly.

Since we have checked all possible divisors up to the square root of 134 and found no divisors other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that 134 is a prime number.

To determine if 626 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

First, we know that 626 is an even number since it ends with a digit 6. Therefore, it is divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any odd numbers. We can start by dividing 626 by 3. Performing the division, we get:

626 ÷ 3 = 208 remainder 2

Since the remainder is not zero, 626 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue this process with other prime numbers, but it is important to note that we only need to check divisibility up to the square root of 626.

The square root of 626 is approximately 25.02. So, we only need to check divisibility up to 25.

First, we check divisibility by 2. Since 2 is even and 763 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check divisibility by 3. To do this, we add up the individual digits of 763: 7 + 6 + 3 = 16. Since 16 is not divisible by 3, 763 is not divisible by 3 either.

Now, we check divisibility by 5. A number is divisible by 5 if its units digit is 0 or 5. Since the units digit of 763 is 3, it is not divisible by 5.

Lastly, we check divisibility by 7. To do this, we use the following approach: multiply the last digit of 763 (which is 3) by 2, and subtract this result from the remaining digits. In this case, 76 - (3 * 2) = 70. Since 70 is divisible by 7, 763 is also divisible by 7.

Since 763 is divisible by 7, it is not a prime number.

First, let's find the factors of 763. To do this, we can divide 763 by numbers starting from 2 and going up to the square root of 763, which is around 27.6.

When we divide 763 by 2, we get a quotient of 381.5. This is not a whole number, which means that 2 is not a factor of 763.

Next, let's try dividing 763 by 3. Again, we get a non-whole number quotient of 254.333. So, 3 is also not a factor of 763.

We continue this process and check for division by other numbers up to 27. However, no other numbers up to 27 divide evenly into 763. Therefore, we can conclude that 763 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Since 763 does not have any other factors besides 1 and 763, it is not a composite number. It is a prime number.

Moving on to the next prime number, 5, we find that 514 is not divisible by 5 since it does not end in 0 or 5. 

After that, we check if 514 is divisible by 7. The difference between twice the last digit of 514 (which is 2) and the remaining digits (51) is 49, which is divisible by 7. Therefore, 514 is divisible by 7.

655 divided by 23 gives a quotient of 28 with a remainder of 11.

Since none of these divisions have a quotient without a remainder, 655 is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. 

Therefore, 655 is a prime number.

No, 778 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2 and 389.
",composite,0
778_Q2,"
To determine if 778 is a prime number, we need to consider its factors. 

First, we know that prime numbers are only divisible by 1 and themselves. Therefore, if any other number divides evenly into 778, then it is not a prime number.

To find the factors of 778, we can start by dividing it by 2. If 778 is divisible by 2, it is not a prime number. 

778 ÷ 2 = 389

Since 778 is divisible by 2, we can continue dividing by other prime numbers to check if it is also divisible by them.

778 ÷ 3 ≈ 259.333
778 ÷ 5 ≈ 155.6
778 ÷ 7 ≈ 111.143

Continuing this process, we see that 778 is divisible by 2, 7, 14, 28, 49, and 98.

Therefore, 778 is not a prime number since it has factors other than 1 and itself.
",composite,0
778_Q3,"
Yes, 778 is a composite number.
",composite,0
778_Q4,"
To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

For 778, let's see if it has any factors:

1. We know that 1 is a factor of every number.
2. We can check if 2 is a factor of 778 by dividing 778 by 2: 778 / 2 = 389. 
   Since the result, 389, is not a whole number, 2 is not a factor of 778.
3. Similarly, we can check if 3 is a factor of 778: 778 / 3 = 259.33
   Again, the result is not a whole number, so 3 is not a factor of 778.
4. We can keep checking for factors until we reach the square root of 778. However, we can already observe that 778 is not divisible by any smaller prime numbers like 2, 3, 5, or 7.

Since we have checked for factors up to the square root, we can conclude that there are no factors other than 1 and 778. Therefore, 778 is not divisible by any other numbers and it is not a composite number.

In conclusion, 778 is not a composite number.

To determine if 721 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

Let's perform a divisibility test by checking if it is divisible by all whole numbers between 2 and the square root of 721 (rounded up to the nearest whole number).

The square root of 721 is approximately 26.87, so we will check divisibility by all numbers from 2 to 27.

Dividing 721 by each of these numbers, we find that it is not evenly divisible by any of them. Therefore, we can conclude that 721 is a prime number.

Hence, 721 is a prime number.
",prime,0

To determine if 721 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by finding the prime factors of 721. We divide 721 by prime numbers starting from 2 until the division results in a whole number or a prime number.

Using this process, we find that 721 can be divided by 7, resulting in 7 × 103 = 721.

Since 7 and 103 are both prime numbers, and 721 can be expressed as the product of these two primes, we can conclude that 721 is a composite number.

To determine whether 145 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. 

Let's check sequentially starting from 2. 
145 divided by 2 does not give a whole number (72.5). 
145 divided by 3 also does not give a whole number (48.333...). 
145 divided by 4 does not give a whole number (36.25).
145 divided by 5 does not give a whole number (29).
145 divided by 6 does not give a whole number (24.166...).

Since 145 is divisible by 7, it is not a prime number.

Therefore, 145 is not a prime number.
",composite,0

No, 145 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
",prime,0
145_Q4,"
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

For the number 145, we can start by dividing it by 2. Since 2 does not divide evenly into 145 (145 ÷ 2 = 72 remainder 1), we move to the next potential factor.

Next, we try dividing 145 by 3, but we find that 3 does not divide evenly into 145 (145 ÷ 3 = 48 remainder 1).

We continue trying larger primes as potential factors, but we find that none divide evenly into 145. 

Therefore, since 145 has no factors other than 1 and itself, it is not a composite number. It is a prime number.

To determine if 622 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If the number ends in an even digit, it is divisible by 2. Since 622 ends in 2, it is divisible by 2.

622 ÷ 2 = 311

Therefore, 622 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2.
",composite,0
622_Q3,"
Yes, 622 is a composite number.
Prime factorization of 622 is 2 * 311.
So, it has factors other than 1 and itself, making it a composite number.
",composite,0
622_Q4,"
To determine if 622 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Starting with 1, we can divide 622 by 1: 

622 ÷ 1 = 622, which gives us a quotient of 622.

Now, let's check if 622 is divisible by any other numbers. We can try dividing it by 2:

622 ÷ 2 = 311, which gives us a quotient of 311.

Since we have found a factor of 2 (besides 1 and 622), we can conclude that 622 is indeed a composite number.

Therefore, the answer is yes, 622 is a composite number.
",composite,0
793_Q1,"
No, 793 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 13 and 61.
",composite,0
793_Q2,"
To determine if 793 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers besides 1 and itself.

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. Since 793 is an odd number and not divisible by 2, we can move on to the next odd number, which is 3.

Let's perform the division 793 ÷ 3:

     264.33
  -----------
3 | 793

The division does not result in an integer quotient, as 264.33 is not a whole number. Therefore, 793 is not divisible by 3.

Next, we can try dividing it by 5:

     158.6
  -----------
5 | 793

Again, the division does not yield a whole number, so 793 is not divisible by 5.

We can continue this process to check if 793 is divisible by other prime numbers, such as 7, 11, 13, etc. However, considering that 793 is a relatively large number, it may be more efficient to use alternative methods to determine if it is a prime number.

As an alternative, we can check if 793 is divisible by any numbers less than or equal to the square root of 793, since any factor larger than its square root would already have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root.

The square root of 793 is approximately 28.15. So we can check if 793 is divisible by any numbers from 2 to 28.

By performing these checks, we find that 793 is not divisible by any of the numbers from 2 to 28.

Therefore, we can conclude that 793 is a prime number.

13 × 61 = 793

From the factor pairs we found, we see that 793 can be divided evenly by 13 and 61, in addition to 1 and 793 itself.

Since 793 has factors other than 1 and itself, it is classified as a composite number.

To determine if 247 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

We can start by dividing 247 by 2. If 247 is divisible by 2, it would not be a prime number.

247 divided by 2 is not a whole number, which means 2 is not a factor of 247.

Next, we can try dividing 247 by 3, since it is the next prime number.

247 divided by 3 is not a whole number either, so 3 is not a factor of 247.

Continuing this process, we can proceed to divide 247 by 5, 7, 11, and so on.

After checking all prime numbers up to the square root of 247, we find that none of them divide 247 evenly.

Therefore, 247 is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself, so we can conclude that 247 is a prime number.

To determine if 247 is a composite number, we need to determine if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can start by finding the prime factorization of 247.

The prime factorization is the process of breaking down the number into its prime factors, which are the prime numbers that can divide the number evenly.

We start by dividing 247 by the smallest prime number, 2. However, 247 is not divisible by 2 as it is an odd number.

We continue by dividing 247 by the next prime number, 3. We find that 247 divided by 3 is approximately 82 remainder 1.

Moving on, we try dividing 247 by the next prime number, 5. Again, it does not divide evenly.

Next, we check if 247 is divisible by 7. We find that 247 divided by 7 is approximately 35 remainder 2.

Continuing, we try 11 as a divisor. However, 247 is not divisible by 11.

Since we have checked all prime numbers up to the square root of 247 (which is approximately 15.7), and found no factors other than 1 and 247, we can conclude that 247 is a composite number.

Therefore, the answer is yes, 247 is a composite number.

209 ÷ 2 = 104 with a remainder of 1

Next, let's divide 209 by 3: 
209 ÷ 3 = 69 with a remainder of 2

We can continue dividing by prime numbers until we find a divisor. 

Now, let's divide 209 by 5: 
209 ÷ 5 = 41 with a remainder of 4

And finally, let's divide 209 by 7: 
209 ÷ 7 = 29 with no remainder 

Since we have found a divisor of 209 (which is 7), it means that 209 is not a prime number.

To find the factors of 209, we can divide it by all positive integers less than or equal to its square root, which is approximately 14.456. 

Upon dividing 209 by integers from 2 to 14, we find that it is divisible by 11 and 19. Thus, the factors of 209 are 1, 11, 19, and 209. 

Since 209 has factors other than 1 and itself, it is indeed a composite number.

2. Check divisibility by odd numbers between 3 and the square root of 893: We can do this by checking if it is divisible by any odd numbers up to the square root of 893, which is approximately 29.9. Checking divisibility by odd numbers 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, and 29, we find that 893 is not divisible by any of these.

The first step is to find the square root of 893. The square root of 893 is approximately 29.9.

Next, we check if 893 is divisible by any numbers starting from 2 up to the square root (29).

When we go through the numbers, we find that 893 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, or 29.

Since there are no factors other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that 893 is a prime number, not a composite number.

Let's start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If 221 is divisible by 2, then it is not a prime number. However, 221 is an odd number, and odd numbers are not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check if it is divisible by any odd number up to the square root of 221. The square root of 221 is approximately 14.87. We can check divisibility by odd numbers up to 14.

221 is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13.

Therefore, we can conclude that 221 is a prime number as it is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Starting with the number 2, we can check if 221 divided by 2 is a whole number. If it is, then we know that 221 is composite.

So, let's divide 221 by 2:

221 ÷ 2 = 110.5

Since the result is not a whole number, we can conclude that 221 is not divisible evenly by 2.

Next, we can try dividing 221 by 3, another prime number:

221 ÷ 3 = 73.6667

Again, the result is not a whole number. 

Continuing this process, we would check division by all prime numbers less than the square root of 221. However, we will stop here since we can already conclude that 221 is not evenly divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

2. Check if the number is divisible by any prime numbers up to the square root of 713. The square root of 713 is approximately 26.7. So, we need to check for divisors up to 26.

3. Starting with the prime number 3, we divide 713 by 3. The result is not a whole number (not divisible), so we move on to the next prime number.

4. Next, we try dividing 713 by 5. Again, the result is not a whole number.

5. Continuing in this manner, we check division by 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29. In each case, the result is not a whole number.

6. Finally, we reach the square root of 713, which is between 26 and 27. Since we haven't found any divisors up to this point, we can conclude that 713 is a prime number.

To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. One way to do this is to divide the number by all integers up to its square root and check if any of the divisions result in a remainder of 0.

In the case of 713, we can start by dividing it by 2:

713 ÷ 2 = 356.5

Since the result is not an integer, 2 is not a factor of 713. We can continue dividing by other integers until we reach the square root of 713, which is approximately 26.7.

Next, we divide by 3:

713 ÷ 3 = 237.67

Again, the result is not an integer. We continue dividing by higher integers, but realize that there are no other integer divisors between 3 and the square root of 713.

Therefore, 713 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. Thus, it is not divisible by any integers other than 1 and 713.

The square root of 517 is approximately 22.75. We can round this up to 23 and use this as our upper limit for testing factors. 

Now, we will start dividing 517 by numbers from 2 up to 23. If any of these divisions result in an integer quotient, then 517 is not a prime number. Otherwise, it is prime.

Let's test:

To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we need to find the positive integer factors of 517. We can start by dividing 517 by 2:

517 ÷ 2 = 258 remainder 1

Since the remainder is not 0, 2 is not a factor of 517. We can continue checking the remaining integers up to the square root of 517, which is approximately 22.72.

Next, let's check if any odd numbers from 3 to 22 are factors of 517:

517 ÷ 3 = 172 remainder 1
517 ÷ 4 = 129 remainder 1
517 ÷ 5 = 103 remainder 2
517 ÷ 6 = 86 remainder 1

517 ÷ 17 = 30 remainder 7
517 ÷ 18 = 28 remainder 13
517 ÷ 19 = 27 remainder 12
517 ÷ 20 = 25 remainder 17
517 ÷ 21 = 24 remainder 13
517 ÷ 22 = 23 remainder 11

We can see that none of the integers from 2 to 22 are factors of 517 (excluding 1 and 517 itself), so 517 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 517 is not a composite number but a prime number.

To determine if 989 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 989 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any odd numbers up to the square root of 989, which is approximately 31.4. 

Starting with 3, we can perform the division 989 ÷ 3 = 329.6666... Since the result is not an integer, 989 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue checking divisibility by the prime numbers up to the square root of 989: 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31.

To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do that, we can start by finding the prime factorization of 989. 

First, we check if it is divisible by 2. If we divide 989 by 2, we get 494 remainder 1. Since 989 is odd, it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 989 is 9 + 8 + 9 = 26, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 989 is not divisible by 3. 

We can proceed similarly by checking divisibility by prime numbers higher than 3, but it is evident that 989 is not divisible by 5, 7, or any other prime numbers up to the square root of 989. 

Hence, we can conclude that 989 is a prime number, not composite.

",composite,0
949_Q2,"
To determine if 949 is a prime number, we need to consider if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if 2 is a factor. If we divide 949 by 2, we get 474.5, which is not a whole number. Therefore, 2 is not a factor of 949.

Next, we can check if 3 is a factor. If we divide 949 by 3, we get 316.333, which is not a whole number. Therefore, 3 is not a factor of 949.

Continuing this process, we can check if 4, 5, 6, and so on, up to the square root of 949, are factors. 

Upon checking through this process, we find that 949 is divisible by 13. When we divide 949 by 13, we get 73, which is a whole number. Therefore, 949 is not a prime number since it has factors other than 1 and itself.

Next, we can try dividing 949 by the next prime number, which is 3. 949 divided by 3 is approximately 316.33, which is not a whole number. Therefore, 3 is not a factor of 949.

We can continue this process and try dividing 949 by 4, 5, 6, and so on. But as we try higher and higher numbers, we will realize that none of them are factors of 949.

So, after checking all possible numbers, we can conclude that 949 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, it is not a composite number.

",composite,0
869_Q2,"
To determine if 869 is a prime number or not, we can follow a step-by-step process. 

First, we can check if 869 is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root. The square root of 869 is approximately 29.47, so we only need to check prime numbers up to 29. 

Next, we check if 869 is divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29. 

- 869 is not divisible by 2 (since it's not even).
- 869 is not divisible by 3 (8 + 6 + 9 = 23, which is not divisible by 3).
- 869 is not divisible by 5 (it doesn't end in 0 or 5).
- 869 is not divisible by 7 (91 * 9 = 819, which is less than 869).
- 869 is not divisible by 11 (80 - 69 = 11, which is not divisible by 11).
- 869 is not divisible by 13 (13 * 66 = 858, which is less than 869).
- 869 is not divisible by 17 (17 * 51 = 867, which is less than 869).
- 869 is not divisible by 19 (19 * 45 = 855, which is less than 869).
- 869 is not divisible by 23 (23 * 37 = 851, which is less than 869).
- 869 is not divisible by 29 (29 * 29 = 841, which is less than 869).

Since none of the prime numbers up to 29 divide evenly into 869, we can conclude that 869 is a prime number.

To determine if 869 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

Let's begin by checking if 869 is divisible by 2. If it is divisible by 2, then it cannot be prime, and hence composite.

869 divided by 2 is 434 with a remainder of 1.

Since 869 is not divisible by 2, let's check if it is divisible by the next prime number, which is 3.

869 divided by 3 is 289 with a remainder of 2.

Again, 869 is not divisible by 3. 

Let's continue checking divisibility by prime numbers. 

869 divided by 5 is 173 with a remainder of 4.

869 divided by 7 is 124 with a remainder of 1.

869 divided by 11 is 79 with a remainder of 0.

869 divided by 13 is 66 with a remainder of 1.

869 divided by 17 is 51 with a remainder of 2.

869 divided by 19 is 45 with a remainder of 14.

We can stop here because we have checked divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 869 (which is approximately 29.5).

Since 869 has multiple factors other than 1 and itself (such as 11, 79, 13, 17), it is indeed a composite number.

To determine whether 737 is a prime number, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

1. Check for divisibility by small prime numbers: 
We can check if 737 is divisible by 2, 3, 5, and 7. If it is divisible by any of these numbers, then it is not prime. 

737 is not divisible by 2 because it is an odd number.
737 is not divisible by 3 because its digits sum up to 17, which is not divisible by 3.
737 is not divisible by 5 because it does not end in 0 or 5.
737 is not divisible by 7 because there is no evident pattern of division by 7.

2. Check for divisibility by other numbers:
We can continue to divide 737 by numbers greater than 7, but it is sufficient to check divisibility up to the square root of 737 (approximately 27.11). If there are no divisors up to the square root, then 737 is prime.

Dividing 737 by numbers from 8 to 27, there are no whole number results, indicating that 737 is not divisible by any number within that range.

Therefore, we can conclude that 737 is a prime number.
",prime,0

To determine if 737 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by dividing 737 by some prime numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, and so on.

737 ÷ 2 = 368.5 (not a whole number)
737 ÷ 3 = 245.666... (not a whole number)
737 ÷ 5 = 147.4 (not a whole number)
737 ÷ 7 = 105.2857... (not a whole number)

Taking the division process further, we can see that there are no other integer factors of 737. Hence, 737 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, we can conclude that 737 is a prime number, not a composite number.

",composite,0
923_Q3,"
Yes, 923 is a composite number.
",composite,0
923_Q4,"
To determine if 923 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. We can do this by finding its prime factorization.

To find the prime factorization of 923, we can start by dividing it by the smallest prime numbers and continue dividing until we obtain a quotient of 1.

923 is not divisible by 2, as it is an odd number.

Dividing 923 by 3, we get: 923 ÷ 3 = 307.67

Since the result is not a whole number, we move on to the next prime number.

Dividing 923 by 5, we get: 923 ÷ 5 = 184.6

Again, the result is not a whole number, so we continue.

Dividing 923 by 7, we get: 923 ÷ 7 = 131.86

Once more, the result is not a whole number.

Dividing 923 by 11, we get: 923 ÷ 11 = 83.909

The quotient is still not a whole number.

Dividing 923 by 13, we get: 923 ÷ 13 = 71

Finally, we have obtained a whole number as the quotient.

Therefore, the prime factorization of 923 is 13 × 71.

Since 923 has factors other than 1 and itself (namely, 13 and 71), it is a composite number.

To determine if 527 is a prime number, we can check for divisibility by numbers smaller than its square root, since all factors of a number occur in pairs, and one factor of the pair must be smaller than or equal to the square root.

The square root of 527 is approximately 22.94. Let's check divisibility by numbers up to 22.

We check if 527 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number and does not end in 0, 2 does not divide it.

Next, we check divisibility by 3. The sum of the digits of 527 is 5 + 2 + 7 = 14, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 3 does not divide 527.

Similarly, we check divisibility by 5. Since 527 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Continuing this process, we find that 527 is not divisible by 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, or 23.

Therefore, we can conclude that 527 is a prime number, as it is not divisible by any numbers up to its square root.

Taking the first step, we can find the square root of 527. The square root of 527 is approximately 22.94. 

Now, let's check if there are any factors of 527 between 2 and 22. 

Dividing 527 by 2, we get a result of approximately 263.5. This is not a whole number, so 2 is not a factor of 527. 

Trying 3, we get a result of approximately 175.7, which isn't a whole number either. Hence, 3 is not a factor of 527. 

Continuing this process, we find that none of the numbers from 2 to 22 are factors of 527. 

Therefore, we can conclude that 527 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

Thus, 527 is a prime number and not a composite number.

Now, we will check if 299 is divisible by any prime numbers less than 18. 

Starting with the smallest prime number, 2, we check if 299 is divisible by 2. However, 299 is not divisible by 2, as it is an odd number. 

We move on to the next prime number, 3. Again, 299 is not divisible by 3, as the sum of its digits is 2 + 9 + 9 = 20, which is not divisible by 3. 

Continuing on, we check if 299 is divisible by 5, but it is not divisible by 5 either. 

Lastly, we check if 299 is divisible by 7. However, we find that 299 is not divisible by 7. 

Since we have checked all prime numbers less than 18 and found no divisors for 299, we can conclude that 299 is a prime number.

Now, we'll check if 559 is divisible by any prime numbers less than 23.

Starting with 2, we find that 559 ÷ 2 = 279.5, which is not a whole number. So, 559 is not divisible by 2.

Moving on to 3, we find that 559 ÷ 3 = 186.33, which is not a whole number. Thus, 559 is not divisible by 3.

Continuing this process, we check the next few prime numbers: 5, 7, 11, and 13. None of them divide evenly into 559.

Next, we try 17. We find that 559 ÷ 17 = 32.882, which is not a whole number. So, 559 is not divisible by 17.

Finally, we try 19. We find that 559 ÷ 19 = 29.421, which is not a whole number. Hence, 559 is also not divisible by 19.

Since we have checked all prime numbers less than the square root of 559 and found no divisors other than 1 and 559 itself, we can conclude that 559 is a prime number.

By checking each number, we find that 559 is divisible by 13 with a quotient of 43. 

So, 559 is not only divisible by 1 and itself, but also by 13 and 43. 

Since 559 has factors other than 1 and itself, it is a composite number.

689 is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, or 29.

Since we have checked all the odd numbers up to the square root of 689 and found that none of them divide 689 evenly, we can conclude that 689 is a prime number.

Therefore, 689 is a prime number.
",prime,0

",composite,0
689_Q4,"
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can start by finding the prime factors of 689. We divide 689 by the smallest prime numbers, starting with 2:

689 ÷ 2 = 344 remainder 1

689 is not divisible by 2, so we continue with the next prime number, which is 3:

689 ÷ 3 = 229 remainder 2

689 is not divisible by 3 either, so we move on to the next prime number, 5:

689 ÷ 5 = 137 remainder 4

Again, 689 is not divisible by 5. We continue this process until we reach a prime number that is greater than the square root of 689. 

However, we can see that at this point, we have already checked the prime numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and so on up to 29, and none of them divide 689 exactly. 

Therefore, we can conclude that 689 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. 

Hence, 689 is a prime number, not a composite number.

No, 781 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 17 and 46, among other numbers.
",composite,0
781_Q2,"
To determine if 781 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. 

Checking for divisibility, we can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If the last digit of 781 is even, then it is divisible by 2. However, the last digit of 781 is 1, which is odd. So 781 is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if 781 is divisible by 3. To do this, we can sum its digits and check if the sum is divisible by 3. Adding 7 + 8 + 1 gives us 16, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 781 is not divisible by 3. 

We can continue this process for other primes like 5, 7, etc., but it is unnecessary because we can already conclude that 781 is not divisible by the smaller primes. 

Therefore, 781 is considered a composite number, not a prime number.
",composite,0
781_Q3,"
Yes, 781 is a composite number.
",composite,0
781_Q4,"
Step 1: To determine if 781 is a composite number, we need to identify its factors.

Step 2: We can start by checking if 781 is divisible by prime numbers starting from 2. If it is divisible by any of these prime numbers, then it is composite.

Step 3: When we divide 781 by 2, we get 390.5, which is not a whole number. This implies that 781 is not divisible by 2.

Step 4: Next, we check if it is divisible by 3. Dividing 781 by 3 gives us 260.333..., which is also not a whole number. Hence, 781 is not divisible by 3.

Step 5: We continue checking for divisibility by prime numbers. Dividing by 5 yields 156.2, which is still not a whole number.

Step 6: The next prime number we can try is 7. When we divide 781 by 7, we obtain 111.571..., which is not a whole number either.

Step 7: Continuing this process, we can conclude that 781 is not divisible by any prime numbers up to its square root.

Step 8: Finally, since 781 is not divisible by any whole numbers other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that it is not a composite number.

Therefore, 781 is not a composite number.

To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Starting with the number 323, we can check if it's divisible by any numbers between 2 and the square root of 323 (which is approximately 18). 

Let's try dividing 323 by some numbers:

- 323 ÷ 2 = 161.5 (not a whole number)
- 323 ÷ 3 = 107.666... (not a whole number)
- 323 ÷ 4 = 80.75 (not a whole number)

- 323 ÷ 11 = 29.363... (not a whole number)
- 323 ÷ 12 = 26.916... (not a whole number)
- 323 ÷ 13 = 24.846... (not a whole number)
- 323 ÷ 14 = 23.071... (not a whole number)
- 323 ÷ 15 = 21.533... (not a whole number)
- 323 ÷ 16 = 20.1875 (not a whole number)
- 323 ÷ 17 = 19 (a whole number)

We see that 323 is divisible by 17 without leaving a remainder, which means it has factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 323 is not a prime number.

To find the factors of 323, we can start by finding its square root, which is approximately 17.97.

Now, let's check if there are any factors of 323 between 2 and 17.

Starting with 2, 323 divided by 2 gives a quotient of 161 with a remainder of 1.
Checking further, 323 divided by 3 gives a quotient of 107 with a remainder of 2.
Checking further, 323 divided by 4 gives a quotient of 80 with a remainder of 3.

Continuing this process, we find that there are no factors of 323 between 2 and 17.

Since 323 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself, it is not a composite number. It is actually a prime number.

We can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root, which in this case is approximately 19.16 (rounded up to 20 for simplicity).

Let's check for divisibility by the prime numbers less than 20:

2: 367 is not divisible by 2.
3: 367 is not divisible by 3.

Since 367 is not divisible by any of these prime numbers, we can conclude that 367 is a prime number.

Hence, 367 is a prime number.

We can see that 367 is not divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12. 

Next, we can check if 13 divides evenly into 367. If we divide 367 by 13, we get a quotient of 28 with a remainder of 11. Therefore, 13 is not a factor of 367. 

We can continue this process by checking if 14, 15, 16, 17, or 18 divide evenly into 367. 

None of these numbers divide evenly into 367, indicating that it does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. 

Therefore, 367 is a prime number, not a composite number.

To determine if 409 is a prime number, we can follow these steps:

1) Check if it is divisible by 2:
Since 409 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we move on to the next step.

2) Check if it is divisible by any odd number up to its square root:
To save time, we only need to check odd numbers as potential divisors. Taking the square root of 409, we round up to the nearest integer (21), so we only need to check odd numbers up to 21 as potential divisors.

Starting from 3, we check if 409 is divisible by 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, or 21.

If any of these numbers divide exactly into 409, then 409 is not a prime number.

However, after checking, we find that 409 is not divisible by any of those numbers.

So, 409 is a prime number.
",prime,0

To determine if 409 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can check for divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 409 (which is approximately 20.22).

Starting with 2, we can see that 409 is not divisible by 2 (remainder is 1). 

Next, we can check with the odd numbers between 3 and 20 since even numbers greater than 2 cannot be factors of 409.

Checking divisibility by 3, we find that the sum of the digits of 409 (4 + 0 + 9) is not divisible by 3, so 409 is not divisible by 3.

Continuing to check with other odd numbers, we observe that 409 is not divisible by 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, or 19.

Since we have checked all the numbers up to the square root of 409, and none of them divide 409, we can conclude that 409 is a prime number.

Therefore, 409 is not a composite number.

Yes, 353 is a prime number.
",prime,0
353_Q2,"
To check if 353 is a prime number, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by dividing 353 by 2, since all even numbers greater than 2 are automatically composite (not prime). In this case, 353 is odd, so it is worth continuing.
2. Next, we divide 353 by all prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 353. This is because if a composite number n has a factor greater than its square root, then it must have a corresponding factor smaller than its square root.
   - The square root of 353 is approximately 18.79.
   - Therefore, we need to divide 353 by primes up to 18.

Now, let's go through the division:

- 353 ÷ 2 = 176 remainder 1
- 353 ÷ 3 = 117 remainder 2
- 353 ÷ 5 = 70 remainder 3
- 353 ÷ 7 = 50 remainder 3
- 353 ÷ 11 = 32 remainder 1
- 353 ÷ 13 = 27 remainder 2
- 353 ÷ 17 = 20 remainder 13

As we can see, none of these divisions result in an integer quotient (no remainder). Therefore, 353 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to its square root.

Based on the steps above, we can conclude that 353 is a prime number since it has no factors other than 1 and itself.

If we find any factor, then 353 is not a prime number and therefore a composite number. However, if we don't find any factors, then 353 is a prime number.

Let's try dividing 353 by all the numbers from 2 to 18:

353 ÷ 2 = 176.5 (not a whole number)
353 ÷ 3 = 117.67 (not a whole number)

",composite,0
2866_Q2,"
To determine if 2866 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If a number is even, it can be divided by 2. 
2866 ÷ 2 = 1433.

1433 is an odd number. To check if it is divisible by 3, we can add its digits together and check if the sum is divisible by 3.

1 + 4 + 3 + 3 = 11. 
Since 11 is not divisible by 3, 1433 is not divisible by 3.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any prime numbers larger than 3. We can start with 5.

1433 is not divisible by 5 as it does not end in 0 or 5.

We can continue checking divisibility by prime numbers until we reach the square root of 2866, which is approximately 53.53. If we don't find any divisors until this point, then 2866 is prime.

Dividing 1433 by prime numbers between 7 and 53 (inclusive), we find that it is not divisible by any of them.

Therefore, 2866 is a prime number since it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

The prime factorization of 2866 is:

2866 = 2 * 1433

Since no other prime numbers divide 1433, we can conclude that 2866 is a composite number.

Therefore, 2866 is a composite number.

To determine if 6865 is a prime number, we can check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If a number is even, it is divisible by 2. However, 6865 is not divisible by 2 since its last digit is 5, which is odd.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we can add up the digits of the number and see if the sum is divisible by 3. 

6 + 8 + 6 + 5 = 25 

Since 25 is not divisible by 3, this means 6865 is not divisible by 3 either.

Now, we can check if it is divisible by 5. If a number ends in 0 or 5, it is divisible by 5. However, 6865 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Since we have checked divisibility by 2, 3, and 5, and found that 6865 is not divisible by any of these prime numbers, it is possible that 6865 is a prime number.

To further investigate, we can check if it has any factors up to the square root of 6865, which is approximately 82.9. 

Starting from 2, we can check if 6865 is divisible by any of the numbers up to 82. 

6856 ÷ 2 = 3438 (not divisible)
6865 ÷ 3 = 2288.3333 (not divisible)
6865 ÷ 4 = 1716.25 (not divisible)
6865 ÷ 5 = 1373 (not divisible)
...

Continuing this process, we find that 6865 is divisible by 5, 7, 17, 29, and 694.

Therefore, 6865 is not a prime number since it has factors other than 1 and itself.

6865 ÷ 5 = 1373 

1373 is a prime number. 

So, the prime factorization of 6865 is 5 × 1373. 

Since 6865 has more than two factors (5, 1373, and 6865), it is a composite number.

First, we know that a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2 - If a number is even, it is not prime.
Since 6098 ends with an even digit (8), it is divisible by 2.

Therefore, 6098 is not a prime number.

To determine whether 6098 is a composite number, we need to find if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To begin, let's try dividing 6098 by 2: 6098 ÷ 2 ≈ 3049. 

Since the result is not a whole number, 2 is not a factor of 6098.

Next, we can try dividing by 3, which is another prime number: 6098 ÷ 3 ≈ 2032.6667.

Again, the result is not a whole number, so 3 is not a factor either.

Continuing with this process, we can test 4, 5, 6, and so on, up to the square root of 6098 (which is approximately 78.084), but it is worth noting that all even numbers greater than 2, including 4, can be skipped as factors.

Finally, after going through this process, we find that 6098 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, we can conclude that 6098 is a prime number, not a composite number.

We can start by dividing 5663 by 2. If it is divisible by 2, then it is not a prime number. However, 5663 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any odd numbers up to the square root of 5663. The square root of 5663 is approximately 75.28. So, we can check divisibility by odd numbers up to 75.

After trying a few numbers, we can see that 5663 is not divisible by any of them. Therefore, we can conclude that 5663 is a prime number, as it does not have any divisors other than 1 and itself.
",prime,0

5663_Q4,"
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has more than two distinct positive divisors.

To find the divisors of 5663, we can start by dividing it by 2, as it is an even number. However, 5663 is not divisible by 2 as there is a remainder.

Next, we can try dividing it by the next prime number, which is 3. If we divide 5663 by 3, we get a quotient of 1887 with a remainder of 2.

Continuing this method, we can divide 5663 by the next prime numbers, which are 5, 7, 11, and so on. However, after trying each prime number up to the square root of 5663 (approximately 75), we find that none divide evenly.

Since there are no prime numbers that divide 5663 evenly, we can conclude that 5663 is a prime number, not a composite number.

To determine whether 2605 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

The square root of 2605 is approximately 51, so we only need to check divisibility by prime numbers up to 51.

Let's start with the smallest prime number, which is 2. 2605 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check divisibility by the next prime number, which is 3. If we add up the digits of 2605 (2 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 13), we see that the sum is not divisible by 3. Hence, 2605 is not divisible by 3.

We continue this process until we reach the next prime number, 5. Once again, the sum of the digits of 2605 (2 + 6 + 0 + 5) is not divisible by 5, so 2605 is not divisible by 5.

Proceeding to the next prime number, 7, the sum of the digits of 2605 is 13, which is not divisible by 7.

Continuing this process, we find that 2605 is not divisible by 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.

Therefore, we can conclude that 2605 is a prime number since it is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If the number ends in an even number, it is divisible by 2. However, 2594 does not end in an even number, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To determine if a number is divisible by 3, we can add up its digits and if the sum is divisible by 3, then the number is divisible by 3. 

2 + 5 + 9 + 4 = 20

Since 20 is not divisible by 3, 2594 is not divisible by 3.

Now, we can check divisibility by 5. If a number ends in 0 or 5, then it is divisible by 5. However, since 2594 does not end in either 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Since 2594 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, we can conclude that it is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 2594.

",composite,0
6614_Q2,"
To determine if 6614 is a prime number, let's start by checking if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

6614 is even because its last digit is 4. Since 2 is the only even prime number, we can divide 6614 by 2:

6614 ÷ 2 = 3307

Now, let's check if 3307 is divisible by any odd numbers up to its square root (√3307 ≈ 57.5):

Starting from 3, we can divide 3307 by odd numbers: 3, 5, 7, 9, ...

However, upon dividing 3307 by 3, we get a remainder of 1. This indicates that 3307 is not divisible by 3.

Continuing with other odd numbers, we find that 3307 is not divisible by any odd number up to 57.5.

Therefore, we can conclude that 6614 is a prime number, since it is only divisible by 1 and itself.

To determine if 7555 is a composite number, we need to find its factors. A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has at least one factor other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if 2 is a factor of 7555. We do this by checking if 7555 is divisible by 2 without leaving any remainder. Since 7555 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if 3 is a factor of 7555. We add up the digits of 7555 (7 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 22) and check if the sum is divisible by 3. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, 7555 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue checking other prime numbers as factors, but we don't need to check any number greater than 87 since 87*87 is less than 7555. Also, we can observe that 7555 ends with 5, which means it is divisible by 5.

Therefore, 7555 is a composite number since it has factors other than 1 and itself.

To determine if 1306 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If the last digit of a number is even, then the number itself is also divisible by 2. However, for 1306, the last digit is 6, which is even, indicating that 1306 is divisible by 2.

So, we can divide 1306 by 2 to get 653. 

Now, let's check if 653 is prime. We can begin by checking if it is divisible by numbers from 2 to the square root of 653. If we find any divisor, then 653 is not prime.

However, upon trying to divide 653 by numbers 2 to its square root (approximately 25.53), we find that none of them divide evenly into 653. This suggests that 653 is a prime number.

Therefore, we conclude that 1306 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2.

First, we need to understand that a composite number is a positive integer that has at least one factor other than 1 and itself. In other words, a composite number can be divided evenly by at least one number other than 1 and the number itself.

To determine if 1527 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and 1527. We can do this by checking all the numbers from 2 to the square root of 1527 (rounded up to the nearest whole number).

The square root of 1527 is approximately 39.12, so we can check all numbers from 2 to 40 to see if any of them divide evenly into 1527.

When we divide 1527 by 2, we get a quotient of 763.5, which is not a whole number. Similarly, when we divide 1527 by 3, we get a quotient of 509, which is also not a whole number. We can continue checking all the numbers up to 40, but since we have already checked the prime numbers up to 3 and the number is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 1527 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

To confirm, we can calculate 4262 ÷ 2 = 2131. 

Since the result is not a whole number, we can conclude that 4262 is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check if 4262 is divisible by 3. We can do this by adding the digits together and checking if the sum is divisible by 3. 

4 + 2 + 6 + 2 = 14

Since 14 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 4262 is not divisible by 3.

So far, we have determined that 4262 is not divisible by 2 or 3. 

Let's continue checking if it is divisible by other prime numbers:

- 5: 4262 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
- 7: By dividing 4262 by 7, we get 608 remainder 6. Since the remainder is not 0, it is not divisible by 7.
- 11: By using the alternating sum method (subtracting the last digit from the remaining number), we get 4 - 2 + 6 - 2 = 6. Since 6 is not divisible by 11, 4262 is not divisible by 11.

Since we have checked the divisibility of 4262 by prime numbers up to 11 and it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 4262 is a composite number.

If the result is divisible by 7, then the whole number is divisible by 7. In this case, we have 777 - (2 * 8) = 777 - 16 = 761. Since 761 is not divisible by 7, 7778 is not divisible by 7.

Since 7778 is not divisible by any of these prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7), we can conclude that 7778 is a prime number.

To determine if 7778 is a composite number, we need to think step by step and analyze its factors.

First, we should check if 7778 is divisible by any number from 2 to its square root. Taking the square root of 7778, we get approximately 88.16.

Next, we try dividing 7778 by numbers from 2 to 88 to check for any whole number quotients. 

After performing the division, we find that 7778 is divisible by 2: 7778 ÷ 2 = 3889. 

Since the division by 2 gave us a whole number quotient, we can deduce that 7778 is divisible by 2. 

Therefore, 7778 is a composite number since it has factors other than 1 and itself.

No, 5818 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2, 7, 11, 17, 19, 23, and other numbers.
",composite,0
5818_Q2,"
To determine if 5818 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If a number is even and not equal to 2, it is not prime because it has 2 as a factor. 5818 is even, so it is divisible by 2.

5818 divided by 2 is 2909. Since 2909 is an odd number, we can check for divisibility by odd numbers starting from 3. 

Next, we can check for divisibility by 3. 5+8+1+8=22, and 22 is not divisible by 3, so 5818 is also not divisible by 3.

Since 5818 is not divisible by 2 or 3, we can continue checking for divisibility by odd numbers up to √5818, which is approximately 76.

Checking for divisibility by 5, we see that the last digit of 5818 is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Checking divisibility by 7, we can use the divisibility rule which states that we can subtract twice the units digit from the rest of the number. The result, 581 - (2*8) = 581 - 16 = 565, is not divisible by 7, so 5818 is not divisible by 7.

We can continue in this manner, checking divisibility by 11, 13, 17, 19, etc., but we can observe that 5818 is divisible by 2. Therefore, it is not a prime number.

So, to answer your question, 5818 is not a prime number.

To determine if 7897 is a prime number, we can follow the following steps:

1. Check if it is divisible by 2. Since 7897 is an odd number (it doesn't end with an even digit), it is not divisible by 2.

2. Check if it is divisible by any odd integer up to the square root of 7897. To simplify the calculations, we can check divisibility up to the closest integer of the square root of 7897. The square root of 7897 is approximately 88.91.

   Starting from 3, we check if 7897 is divisible by any odd integer up to 88. The first few odd divisors we'll check are 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, etc.

   Checking each of these divisors, we find that none of them divide 7897 evenly. Thus, 7897 is not divisible by any of these odd integers.

To check if 7897 is divisible by 3, we can add its digits together: 7 + 8 + 9 + 7 = 31. Since 31 is not divisible by 3, we can move on to the next prime number, which is 5.

If a number is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, it is unlikely to be divisible by any other small prime number. We can conclude that 7897 is a prime number since it is not divisible by any of these prime numbers.

Therefore, 7897 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.

To determine if 4399 is a prime number, we can check for its divisibility by any prime numbers up to the square root of 4399. 

First, we find the square root of 4399. Approximating it to the nearest whole number, the square root is approximately 66.

Now, we will check if 4399 is divisible by any prime numbers up to 66.

Starting with 2, we divide 4399 by 2. The result is not an integer.

Next, we move on to 3. Dividing 4399 by 3, we again don't get an integer.

Continuing this process, we move on to 5, 7, 11, and so on until we reach the prime number 61.

When we try dividing 4399 by 61, we get 72.1803, which is not an integer.

Since none of the prime numbers up to the square root of 4399 divide it evenly, we can conclude that 4399 is a prime number.

To determine if 6499 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any integers other than 1 and itself.

We can start by finding the square root of 6499, which is approximately 80.61.

Next, we can check if 6499 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 80, such as 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc.

Starting with 2, we can divide 6499 by 2 and check if there is no remainder. However, 6499 divided by 2 equals 3249.5, which results in a remainder. Hence, 6499 is not divisible by 2.

We can continue this process with other prime numbers, but if 6499 is not divisible by 2, there is no need to check 3, 5, or any other even numbers.

Therefore, we can conclude that 6499 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 80. Hence, it does not have any divisors other than 1 and itself.

Based on this reasoning, we can say that 6499 is a prime number.

To determine if 7313 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

The first step is to find the square root of 7313. The square root of 7313 is approximately 85.51 (rounded to two decimal places). 

Now, we need to check if any prime numbers up to 85.51 divide 7313 evenly.

Starting with 2, we see that 7313 is not divisible by 2 (i.e., the remainder when dividing 7313 by 2 is not 0).

Next, let's check 3. The sum of the digits of 7313 (7 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 14) is not divisible by 3, so 7313 is not divisible by 3.

Moving on to 5, 7313 is not divisible by 5 because it does not end in 0 or 5.

Continuing with 7, 7313 is not divisible by 7 because the remainder when dividing it by 7 is 4.

Also, let's check numbers up to the square root of 7313 (85.51):

Checking 11, we find that 7313 is not divisible by 11 since the sum of the first, third, and fifth digits (7 + 1 + 3 = 11) minus the sum of the second and fourth digits (3 + 3 = 6) is not divisible by 11.

We can continue this process for each prime number up to the square root of 7313. However, since the process can be time-consuming, we can conclude that 7313 is a prime number if none of the prime numbers up to the square root divide it evenly.

In this case, since none of the prime numbers up to the square root of 7313 divide it evenly, we can conclude that 7313 is indeed a prime number.

The square root of 7313 is approximately 85.5. So we only need to check divisibility up to 85.

Let's start with 2. When we divide 7313 by 2, we get a quotient of 3656 with a remainder of 1.
Let's try 3. When we divide 7313 by 3, we get a quotient of 2437 with a remainder of 2.
Let's try 4. When we divide 7313 by 4, we get a quotient of 1828 with a remainder of 1.
We can continue this process, trying all the numbers up to 85, and we observe that 7313 is not evenly divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Since we cannot find any factors of 7313 other than 1 and 7313 itself, we can conclude that 7313 is a prime number, not a composite number.

To determine if 9047 is a prime number, we will check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Let's start by checking divisibility by 2. If 9047 is even, it is not a prime number. However, 9047 is an odd number since it does not end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.

Next, we check if 9047 is divisible by any odd numbers up to its square root. If there are no factors found, then it is a prime number.

To find the square root of 9047, we can use a calculator or estimate it to be around 95 (since 95^2 is 9025, which is very close to 9047).

Now, let's check if any prime odd numbers less than or equal to 95 divide evenly into 9047.

Starting from 3, we find that 9047 divided by 3 is not an integer, which means it is not divisible by 3.

Next, we check divisibility by 5. Since 9047 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Checking divisibility by 7, we find that 9047 divided by 7 is not an integer.

Continuing to check for divisibility by other prime numbers, we can skip 11 since 9047 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7. Similarly, we can skip 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31.

We continue this process until reaching the square root of 9047 (around 95). However, since we already exhausted the prime numbers less than or equal to 31, and we found no factors, we can conclude that 9047 is a prime number.

Trying out divisions can be time-consuming, so we can use the property that if a number does not have any prime factors less than or equal to its square root, then it is a prime number.

By checking divisions, we find that 9047 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89 or 93.

By performing the calculations, we find that none of the numbers from 2 to 62 divide 3869 evenly.

2. Secondly, we can check if the number is divisible by any odd numbers from 3 up to the square root of the number. If any of these values divide evenly into the number, then it is not a prime number.
  
Let's apply these steps to 9313:

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we can sum the digits of 8357 (8 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 23) and check if the sum is divisible by 3. Since 23 is not divisible by 3, 8357 is also not divisible by 3.

Now, we will check if it is divisible by any number up to the square root of 8357. The square root of 8357 is approximately 91.42, so we only need to check divisibility up to 91.

Testing divisibility by numbers like 5, 7, 11, and so on would be time-consuming. Therefore, we can use a more efficient approach by testing for divisibility by prime numbers.

We find that 8357 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 91.

Therefore, based on our analysis, 8357 is a prime number.

To determine if 8357 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

The factors of 8357 are the numbers that divide evenly into 8357. We can find these factors by performing repeated division.

To start, we can try dividing 8357 by 2. If it is divisible by 2, then we know it is composite.

8357 ÷ 2 = 4178.5

Since 8357 is not divisible by 2, we move on to the next potential factor, which is 3.

8357 ÷ 3 = 2785.6667

Again, 8357 is not divisible by 3. We continue checking potential factors.

8357 ÷ 4 = 2089.25
8357 ÷ 5 = 1671.4
8357 ÷ 6 = 1392.8333
8357 ÷ 7 = 1193.8571
8357 ÷ 8 = 1044.625
8357 ÷ 9 = 928.5556
8357 ÷ 10 = 835.7

We can see from these divisions that none of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 divide evenly into 8357. 

So, 8357 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. Thus, 8357 is not composite.

Let's start with the method of prime factorization:
We need to check if 4331 is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root (√4331 ≈ 65.86). 

Starting with 2, we can quickly check if 4331 is divisible by 2 by seeing if it is even or ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. Since 4331 does not meet this criteria, we move on.

Next, we check for divisibility by 3. By summing the digits of 4331 (4+3+3+1 = 11), we can see that it is not divisible by 3.

Now, we move on to checking divisibility by 5. If 4331 ends in 0 or 5, it would be divisible by 5. However, 4331 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Continuing with this process, we move to checking for divisibility by 7. Unfortunately, there are no quick tricks to check this, so we would need to perform long division. Since 4331 ÷ 7 = 618 remainder 5, we can conclude that 4331 is not divisible by 7.

By using this process, checking divisibility by prime numbers, none of them divide into 4331 evenly. Therefore, we can conclude that 4331 is a prime number.

So, yes, 4331 is a prime number.

The square root of 4331 is approximately 65.8, so we need to check for divisibility by all whole numbers from 2 to 66. 

By performing the divisions, we find that 4331 is not divisible by any number in this range, which means it does not have any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

Therefore, we can conclude that 4331 is a prime number.

Step 2: Next, we check divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 6667, which is approximately 81.7.

Step 1: Find the integer square root of the number.
The square root of 7663 is approximately 87.6.

Step 2: Check for divisibility by prime numbers less than or equal to the square root.
We need to check if 7663 is divisible by prime numbers less than or equal to 87.6. The prime numbers up to the square root are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, and 87.

Taking 7663 as the dividend and performing division by each prime number, we observe that none of these prime numbers divide 7663 completely without any remainder.

Step 4: Determine if 7663 is a prime number.
Since none of the prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 7663 divide it entirely, we can conclude that 7663 is a prime number.

So yes, 7663 is a prime number.

To determine if 7663 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. We can do this by checking divisibility with prime numbers up to the square root of 7663, which is approximately 87.6.

Starting with the smallest prime number, 2, let's try dividing 7663 by 2. Calculating the quotient, we find that 7663 ÷ 2 = 3831.5. Since the quotient is not an integer, 7663 is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's try dividing 7663 by 3. Again, calculating the quotient, we find that 7663 ÷ 3 = 2554.3333. As the quotient is also not an integer, 7663 is not divisible by 3.

We continue this process with prime numbers up to 87, but we don't find any prime divisors. Thus, we can conclude that 7663 is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

To determine if 9169 is a prime number, we can use a step-by-step approach.

First, we know that a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

So, we can begin by checking if any number less than 9169 divides it evenly without leaving a remainder.

We start by checking division with 2:

9169 ÷ 2 = 4584.5

Since 9169 divided by 2 doesn't result in a whole number, we move on to the next integer, which is 3.

9169 ÷ 3 = 3056.333...

Again, this division doesn't produce a whole number, so we proceed to the next integer, which is 4.

9169 ÷ 4 = 2292.25

Once more, this division doesn't yield a whole number. We continue this process until we reach the square root of 9169 because any factor larger than the square root would be paired with a factor smaller than the square root, which we have already tested.

The square root of 9169 is approximately 95.842.

Thus, we need to check divisibility by all whole numbers up to 95.

After dividing 9169 by several different numbers, we find that it is not divisible evenly by any of them.

Therefore, we can conclude that 9169 is a prime number.

To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To find the factors of 9169, we can start by dividing it by small prime numbers. If we don't find any factor after checking prime numbers up to the square root of 9169, then we can conclude that 9169 is a prime number.

Let's check: 

1. Check division by 2: 9169 ÷ 2 = 4584.5 (not a factor)

Since we have checked the primes up to the square root of 9169 (approximately 95.8), and we haven't found any whole number factors, we can conclude that 9169 is a prime number.

To do this, we can start by checking if any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 8639 divide evenly into it.

The square root of 8639 is approximately 92.95. Thus, we need to check if any prime numbers up to 92 divide 8639 evenly.

Checking through the prime numbers less than 92, we find that none of them divide 8639 evenly.

Therefore, we can conclude that 8639 is a prime number.

To determine if 8639 is a composite number, we need to check if it can be divided evenly by any whole number other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root. The square root of 8639 is approximately 92.9, so we can check divisibility by prime numbers up to 92.

Checking divisibility by prime numbers:
- We start with 2, but 8639 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.
- We move on to 3. The sum of the digits of 8639 is 8 + 6 + 3 + 9 = 26, but 26 is not divisible by 3, so 8639 is not divisible by 3.
- Next, we check divisibility by 5. Since 8639 does not end in 5 or 0, it is not divisible by 5.
- Moving on to 7, we use the divisibility rule for 7, which states that we can subtract twice the last digit from the remaining truncated number. For 863, we subtract 2 times 3 = 6 from 86, resulting in 80. Since 80 is divisible by 7, we can further test divisibility. Subtracting 2 times 0 from 8 results in 8, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 8639 is not divisible by 7.
- Similarly, for 11, we use the alternating-sum rule. Adding and subtracting the digits of 8639 alternately gives us 8 - 6 + 3 - 9 = -4. Since -4 is not divisible by 11, neither is 8639.
- We repeat the process for prime numbers up to 13, but none of them evenly divide 8639.

Since 8639 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root, we can conclude that it is not divisible by any other whole number, making it a prime number.

Therefore, 8639 is not a composite number.

To determine whether a number is composite, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if 2 and 3 are factors of 4891. If the number is divisible by any of these prime numbers, it will be composite.

To check if 2 is a factor, we can look at the last digit of 4891, which is 1. Since 1 is an odd number, 4891 is not divisible by 2.

To check if 3 is a factor, we can sum up the digits of 4891: 4 + 8 + 9 + 1 = 22. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, 4891 is also not divisible by 3.

Since neither 2 nor 3 are factors of 4891, we can conclude that 4891 is not divisible by any prime number other than 1 and itself.

2. Next, we need to check if 9517 is divisible by any prime numbers up to the square root of 9517 (approximately 97.54). We only need to check prime numbers because if a number is divisible by a non-prime number, it would also be divisible by its prime factors.

3. Check divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits in 9517 is 9 + 5 + 1 + 7 = 22. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 9517 is not divisible by 3.

4. Check divisibility by 5: Since the last digit is 7, which is not 0 or 5, we can conclude that 9517 is not divisible by 5.

5. Check divisibility by 7: We can do a simple divisibility test by subtracting twice the last digit (2 x 7 = 14) from the rest of the number (951 - 14 = 937). This process can be repeated until we get a small enough number to determine its divisibility. In this case, 93 - 2 x 7 = 79. Since 79 is not divisible by 7, we can conclude that 9517 is not divisible by 7.

Continuing in this manner, we can try dividing by the prime numbers up to the square root of 7291, which is approximately 85.3. However, no prime number from 2 to 85 evenly divides 7291.

Since we have not found any factors other than 1 and 7291, we can conclude that 7291 is a prime number, not a composite number.

To determine if 2117 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check divisibility by 2. Since 2117 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check divisibility by 3. The sum of its digits is 2 + 1 + 1 + 7 = 11, which is not divisible by 3. 

We can skip checking divisibility by 5 because 2117 doesn't end in 5 or 0, so it is not divisible by 5. 

Continuing this pattern, we can try dividing 2117 by prime numbers up to its square root, which is approximately 46. 

Upon dividing 2117 by primes such as 7, 11, 13, etc., we find that it is not divisible by any of them.

To determine if 7969 is a prime number, we can check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root, which is approximately 89. 

We can start by checking if 7969 is divisible by 2. Since 7969 is an odd number and does not end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if 7969 is divisible by 3. Adding the individual digits of 7969 (7 + 9 + 6 + 9) gives us 31, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 7969 is not divisible by 3.

Now, we can move on to checking if 7969 is divisible by prime numbers larger than 3, but less than its square root. We don't need to check all the prime numbers in this range, as the divisibility test for large numbers can be time-consuming.

Checking prime numbers up to 11, we see that 7969 is not divisible by 5, 7, or 11.

The square root of 1387 is approximately 37.27, so we only need to check prime numbers up to 37.

Let's check the divisibility of 1387 by prime numbers less than or equal to 37:

For the number 1387, we can start by dividing it by 2. If it is divisible by 2, then it is composite. If not, we can continue dividing by consecutive numbers until we find a divisor or reach the square root of the number.

Let's test divisibility by 2:

Since 1387 is not divisible by 2, let's try the next prime number as a divisor, which is 3.

1387 ÷ 3 ≈ 462.33

Again, 1387 is not divisible by 3. We can continue testing divisibility by other prime numbers like 5, 7, 11, and so on.

1387 ÷ 5 ≈ 277.4
1387 ÷ 7 ≈ 198.14
1387 ÷ 11 ≈ 126.09

We don't have to test further because we have reached 11, which is greater than the square root of 1387.

Step 1: Check for Divisibility by Small Primes
First, we check if 6791 is divisible by any small prime numbers, such as 2, 3, 5, or 7. If it is divisible by any of these numbers, then it is not a prime number. In this case, 6791 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7.

Step 2: Check for Divisibility by Numbers Up to the Square Root
Next, we check for divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 6791. The square root of 6791 is approximately 82.46. We can check for divisibility by prime numbers up to 82.

A composite number is any positive integer that has at least one factor other than 1 and itself. In other words, it is divisible by numbers other than 1 and itself. 

Now, let's think step by step to see if 6791 is a composite number: 

1. We can start by checking if 6791 is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is not a prime number and it is composite. 
Checking, we find that 6791 is not divisible by 2 since its last digit is 1, which means it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we can check divisibility by 3. If the sum of the digits of 6791 is divisible by 3, then it is composite. 
Checking, we find that 6 + 7 + 9 + 1 = 23, which is not divisible by 3.

3. We can also verify divisibility by 5. If a number ends with 0 or 5, then it is divisible by 5 and is not prime. 
Checking, we find that 6791 does not end in 0 or 5.

4. One more factor we can check is divisibility by 7. There is a rule known as ""divisibility by 7"" that can help us determine this. Unfortunately, 6791 is not easily divisible by 7 using this rule.

Since we have exhausted our general divisibility checks, we can conclude that 6791 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. 
Therefore, 6791 is a prime number, not a composite number.

To determine whether 5021 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

To begin, let's check if it's divisible by 2. If it's even, then it's not a prime number since it's divisible by 2. However, 5021 is an odd number, so we continue.

Next, we can check if it's divisible by any odd numbers up to its square root, which is approximately 70.88. We can test for divisibility by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc., but it would be quite time-consuming to test all these prime numbers.

Since 5021 is a moderately large number, let's use a primality test called the trial division method. This method involves checking if any prime numbers up to the square root of the given number divide evenly into it.

Taking the square root of 5021, we get approximately 70.91. Therefore, we only need to check up to 70 if 5021 is composite.

Next, we can check divisibility by odd numbers up to the square root of 5059. The square root of 5059 is approximately 71.1, so we will check divisibility up to 71.

We divide 5059 by each odd number from 3 to 71. If any of the divisions result in a whole number, then 5059 is not a prime number. However, if none of the divisions result in a whole number, then 5059 is a prime number.

To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can start by finding the factors of 4673. We can do this by finding all the numbers that divide exactly into 4673.

First, we check if 2 is a factor of 4673. We perform the division: 

4673 ÷ 2 = 2336 with a remainder of 1.

Since 2 is not a factor of 4673, we move on to the next possible factor which is 3.

Next, we check if 3 is a factor of 4673. We perform the division:

4673 ÷ 3 = 1557 with a remainder of 2.

Again, 3 is not a factor of 4673, so we continue to the next possible factor.

After checking factors up to the square root of 4673 (√4673 ≈ 68.34), we find that none of these numbers divide exactly into 4673.

Therefore, we can conclude that 4673 is a prime number, not a composite number.

Since 4893.5 is not a whole number, 2 is not a factor of 9787. 

Next, we try dividing by 3:
9787 ÷ 3 = 3262.333...

Again, this is not a whole number, so 3 is not a factor either. 

We continue this process with increasing numbers until we reach the square root of 9787.

The square root of 9787 is approximately 98.93. 
Therefore, we only need to check for factors up to 98.

A composite number is a positive integer that has more than two distinct positive divisors. In other words, it is a number that can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 and itself.

To check if 3511 is composite, we need to find its divisors. We can start by dividing it by all the integers smaller than its square root.

The square root of 3511 is approximately 58.34. We only need to check the divisors up to 58, as any larger divisors would result in a quotient less than 58.

After that, we check if 8363 is divisible by 5. Since the last digit is 3, which is not 0 or 5, 8363 is not divisible by 5.

Finally, we check if 8363 is divisible by any prime numbers between 5 and the square root of 8363. Calculating the square root of 8363 is approximately 91.48.

We can check divisors up to 91.48, but after going through some calculations, we find that 8363 does not have any divisors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 8363 is a prime number.

To determine if 3089 is a prime number, we can check if it is divisible by any number up to its square root.

The square root of 3089 is approximately 55.57 (rounded to two decimal places). So we only need to check divisibility up to 55.

Start by checking if 3089 is divisible by 2. Since 3089 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can eliminate divisibility by 2.

Next, check if 3089 is divisible by any odd number up to 55. We can systematically check by dividing 3089 by each odd number.

After performing the division test, we find that 3089 is not divisible by any odd numbers up to 55.

To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to consider if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we need to find the factors of 3089. We can start by dividing it by 2 and see if it is an even number: 

3089 ÷ 2 = 1544.5

Since the result is not an integer, 3089 is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can try dividing it by 3:

3089 ÷ 3 = 1029.6667

Again, the result is not an integer, so 3089 is not divisible by 3. 

We can continue this process, dividing it by 4, 5, 6, and so on, checking if 3089 is divisible by any of these numbers. However, we can observe that trying to divide it by any number up to its square root would be sufficient to determine if it is composite. 

The square root of 3089 is approximately 55.58. Therefore, we can check if 3089 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 55. 

We find that 3089 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, or 55.

To determine if 6389 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If the number ends in an even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), it is divisible by 2. However, since 6389 ends in 9, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we can add up the digits of the number and see if the sum is divisible by 3. In this case, 6 + 3 + 8 + 9 = 26, which is not divisible by 3.

Now, we can check divisibility by 5. If the number ends in 0 or 5, it is divisible by 5. However, since 6389 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

We can continue this process, checking for divisibility by 7, 11, and so on. However, in this case, we can already see that 6389 is not divisible by any of these numbers.
