5906_Q4,Q4,"
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

The number 5906 is not divisible by 2, as the last digit is not even.

To check if it is divisible by 3, we add all the digits together: 5 + 9 + 0 + 6 = 20. The sum is not divisible by 3 since 20 is not divisible by 3.

Since it is not divisible by either 2 or 3, it is safe to say that it is not divisible by any smaller prime numbers. Therefore, 5906 could still be a composite number.
