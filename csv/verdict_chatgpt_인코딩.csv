To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

For number 65, we can start by dividing it by 2, which is the smallest prime number. Since 65 is not divisible evenly by 2 (as 65/2 = 32.5 which is not a whole number), we can conclude that 65 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can try dividing 65 by 3. Again, 65 is not divisible evenly by 3 (as 65/3 = 21.6666... which is not a whole number).

With this process, we continue checking divisibility up to the square root of 65 (approximately 8.06). Checking divisibility by numbers beyond this point is not necessary since any factors of 65 must be smaller than its square root.

Next, we check if 85 is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits in 85 is 8 + 5 = 13, which is not divisible by 3. Hence, 85 is not divisible by 3.

Now, we check if 85 is divisible by 5. Since 85 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Finally, we can check if 85 is divisible by 7. By dividing 85 by 7, we get a quotient of 12 with a remainder of 1. Hence, 85 is not divisible by 7.

Since we have checked all the prime numbers up to the square root of 85 (which is approximately 9.22), we can conclude that 85 is a prime number.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. Adding the digits of 88, we get 8 + 8 = 16. Since 16 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 88 is not divisible by 3.

We can also check if it is divisible by 4. If the last two digits of 88,  are divisible by 4, then 88 is also divisible by 4. In this case, 88 is divisible by 4 since 88 ¡À 4 = 22.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any odd numbers. We can start by dividing 626 by 3. Performing the division, we get:

626 ¡À 3 = 208 remainder 2

Since the remainder is not zero, 626 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue this process with other prime numbers, but it is important to note that we only need to check divisibility up to the square root of 626.

The square root of 626 is approximately 25.02. So, we only need to check divisibility up to 25.

To determine if 118 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If a number is even, then it is definitely divisible by 2. Since 118 is even (ends in 8), it is divisible by 2.

Dividing 118 by 2 gives us 59. 

Now, we need to check if 59 is divisible by any number between 2 and its square root (inclusive). 

We can check divisibility by all prime numbers up to the square root of 59, which is approximately 7.68. 

Checking divisibility by numbers up to 7:

Let's perform the test:

1) We can immediately see that 2 does not divide 718 evenly, as it leaves a remainder of 1.

2) Next, we check if 3 divides 718 evenly. By adding the digits of 718 (7 + 1 + 8 = 16) and checking if this sum is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 3 does not divide 718 evenly.

3) Similarly, adding the digits of 718 (7 + 1 + 8 = 16), we can check if 9 divides 718 evenly. Since 16 is not divisible by 9, we can conclude that 9 does not divide 718 evenly.

4) Finally, we check for divisibility by 5. Since 718 does not end with 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Based on these tests, we can conclude that 718 is not divisible by any of these numbers and therefore it is a prime number.

Therefore, 718 is not a prime number.

First, we need to understand what a composite number is. A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has divisors other than 1 and itself. In other words, a composite number can be evenly divided by numbers other than 1 and itself.

To determine if 205 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and 205.

We can start by checking if 205 is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is not a composite number because 2 and 205 would be divisors.

205 divided by 2 is not an integer (205 ¡À 2 = 102.5), so 205 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if 205 is divisible by 3.

205 divided by 3 is not an integer (205 ¡À 3 = 68.33), so 205 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue this process by checking other numbers such as 4, 5, 6, and so on until we find a divisor or reach the square root of 205.

However, we can stop here because we have already determined that 205 is not divisible by 2 or 3. Since we have not found any other divisors, we can conclude that 205 is a composite number.

To determine if 745 is a composite number, we should check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we need to find the prime factorization of 745. To do this, we can divide it by prime numbers starting from 2 and keep dividing until we can't divide anymore. 

Let's start with dividing 745 by 2: 

745 ¡À 2 = 372.5 

Since 372.5 is not an integer, we move on to the next prime number. 

Dividing 745 by 3: 

745 ¡À 3 = 248.33 

Again, we get a non-integer number, so we continue. 

Dividing 745 by 5: 

745 ¡À 5 = 149 

This time we get an integer, which means that 5 is a factor of 745. 

Now, let's divide 745 by 5: 

745 ¡À 5 = 149 

We have already found 149 as a factor of 745. 

Therefore, the prime factorization of 745 is 5 ¡¿ 149. 

Since 745 has factors other than 1 and itself (5 and 149), it is a composite number.

746_Q2,Q2,"
To determine if 746 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, let's check if it is divisible by 2. If a number is even, it can be divided by 2. Since 746 is even (the last digit is 6), it is divisible by 2. 

746 ¡À 2 = 373

So, 746 is divisible by 2 and can be written as the product of 2 and 373.

To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If a number is even, it is divisible by 2. In this case, since 235 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any odd numbers up to the square root of 235 (which is approximately 15.33). We can start with 3. 

Dividing 235 by 3 gives a quotient of 78 with a remainder of 1. This means 235 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue this process, checking for divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 235. 

Dividing 235 by 5 gives a quotient of 47 with a remainder of 0. This means 235 is divisible by 5.

Next, we can check if there are any factors of 237 between 2 and 15.4. 

By testing numbers, we find that 237 is divisible evenly by 3. The quotient is 79. 

Therefore, 3 and 79 are factors of 237.

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If 753 is an even number, then it is divisible by 2. However, 753 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. By summing the digits of 753 (7 + 5 + 3 = 15) and checking if the sum is divisible by 3, we can determine if 753 is also divisible by 3. In this case, the sum of the digits (15) is divisible by 3, so 753 is divisible by 3.

We can start by finding the square root of 755, which is approximately 27.5. Now, we will check if any numbers from 2 to 27 divide 755 evenly.

By trying these values, we see that 5 divides 755 evenly (because 755 ¡À 5 = 151). So, 755 can be written as 5 ¡¿ 151.

Since 5 and 151 are both greater than 1 and are not equal to 755, we can confirm that 755 is indeed a composite number.

To determine whether 763 is a prime number or not, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we check divisibility by 2. Since 2 is even and 763 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check divisibility by 3. To do this, we add up the individual digits of 763: 7 + 6 + 3 = 16. Since 16 is not divisible by 3, 763 is not divisible by 3 either.

Now, we check divisibility by 5. A number is divisible by 5 if its units digit is 0 or 5. Since the units digit of 763 is 3, it is not divisible by 5.

Lastly, we check divisibility by 7. To do this, we use the following approach: multiply the last digit of 763 (which is 3) by 2, and subtract this result from the remaining digits. In this case, 76 - (3 * 2) = 70. Since 70 is divisible by 7, 763 is also divisible by 7.

First, let's check if it is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is not a prime number because it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

766 divided by 2 is equal to 383. 

Since 766 is divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder, it means it is not a prime number.

First, we find the square root of 766, which is approximately 27.7. We don't need to check all the way up to 27.7, but we can check up to the nearest integer, which is 28.

Checking each number from 2 to 28, we see that 766 is divisible by 2, as 2 x 383 = 766. Therefore, 766 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.

Next, we test if 3 is a divisor. By adding the digits of 265 (2+6+5), we get 13. Since 13 is not divisible by 3, 265 is also not divisible by 3.

Now, we test if 5 is a divisor. Since the last digit of 265 is 5, it is divisible by 5.

Next, let's check if 785 is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 785 is 7 + 8 + 5 = 20. Since 20 is not divisible by 3, it means that 785 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue this process and check if 785 is divisible by 4, 5, 6, and so on. However, we notice that 785 is relatively close to the square root of 785, which is approximately 28.04.

So, we only need to check for divisibility up to 28.

",composite,composite,3_digit_easy_composite,789,3,263,correct
789_Q2,Q2,"
To determine if 789 is a prime number, we need to do a prime factorization of it. 

The prime factorization is the process of finding the prime numbers that multiply together to give us the original number. 

To do this, we can start by dividing 789 by 2, and we get:
789 ¡À 2 = 394 remainder 1

Since 789 is not divisible by 2, we move on to the next prime number, which is 3. Dividing 789 by 3, we get:
789 ¡À 3 = 263 remainder 0

Therefore, we have successfully divided 789 by a prime number. 

Now, let's continue dividing 263 by prime numbers. We try dividing by 3 again, but it is not divisible.

Next, we divide 263 by 5, and we get:
263 ¡À 5 = 52 remainder 3

263 is not divisible by 5, so let's try dividing by 7:
263 ¡À 7 = 37 remainder 4

Again, 263 is not divisible by 7. 

Since we have tried dividing by prime numbers up to ??63 (which is approximately 16), and none of them divide evenly into 263, we can conclude that 263 is a prime number.

Therefore, the prime factorization of 789 is 3 ¡¿ 263. 

Since 789 has more than two distinct prime factors (3 and 263), it is not a prime number.

Since 789 has factors other than 1 and itself (1 and 789), namely 3 and 263, we can conclude that 789 is a composite number.

To determine if 278 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 278 is an even number, it is divisible by 2.

278 ¡À 2 = 139

So, 278 is divisible by 2 and can be written as the product of 2 and 139.

Therefore, 278 is not a prime number.

First, we need to find the square root of 278, which is approximately 16.67.

Next, we check if 278 is divisible by any numbers between 2 and 16.

When we test numbers between 2 and 16, we see that 278 is divisible by 2. Dividing 278 by 2 gives us 139, which is a prime number. 

Since 278 has factors other than 1 and itself (2 and 139), we can conclude that 278 is a composite number.

To determine if 791 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by finding the prime factorization of 791. This involves finding the prime numbers that, when multiplied together, equal 791.

One way to find the prime factorization is to perform trial division: divide 791 by prime numbers starting from 2 until we can't divide anymore.

Let's try dividing 791 by 2:
791 ¡À 2 = 395.5

Since the result is not a whole number, 2 is not a factor of 791.

Let's try dividing 791 by 3:
791 ¡À 3 = 263.67

Again, the result is not a whole number, so 3 is not a factor of 791.

Continuing with trial division, let's try dividing 791 by 5:
791 ¡À 5 = 158.2

Once again, the result is not a whole number, so 5 is not a factor of 791.

Trying 791 divided by 7:
791 ¡À 7 = 113

Here, we finally get a whole number result of 113, which means that 7 is a factor of 791.

So, we have found that 791 can be divided evenly by 7, yielding the factor pair (7, 113).

Since 791 has factors other than 1 and itself, namely 7 and 113, we can conclude that 791 is a composite number.

Next, we can check if 3 is a divisor of 295. To do this, we add up the digits of 295 (2 + 9 + 5 = 16) and check if this sum is divisible by 3. Since 16 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 295 is not divisible by 3. 

We can continue this process for other prime numbers such as 5, 7, 11, and so on, to check for divisors. However, we can save time by using a calculator or a prime factorization calculator to find the prime factors of 295.

To determine if 301 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. We can do this by finding its prime factorization. 

First, let's check if 301 is divisible by 2. Since 301 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we move on to the next prime number, which is 3. 

When we divide 301 by 3, we get 100 with a remainder of 1. This means that 3 is not a factor of 301. 

Next, we try dividing 301 by 5. Again, we get 60 with a remainder of 1. 

Continuing in this way, we find that 7, 11, and 13 are also not factors of 301. 

Finally, when we try dividing 301 by 17, we get 17 with no remainder. This means that 301 is divisible by 17. 

Since 301 has a factor other than 1 and itself (17), it is not a prime number.

To determine if 314 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can see that 314 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2. Thus, 2 is a factor of 314. 

Next, we can divide 314 by 2 to get 157. Since 157 is an odd number, we can now check if it has any prime factors. 

We can begin by trying to divide it by prime numbers up to the square root of 157, which is approximately 12.5. 

Checking if 157 is divisible by 3, we find that the sum of its digits is 1 + 5 + 7 = 13, which is not divisible by 3. 

Similarly, checking divisibility by 5, we see that 157 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5. 

Next, checking divisibility by 7, we find that 157 can be divided evenly by 7, as 7 multiplied by 22 is equal to 154. 

Therefore, the prime factors of 314 are 2 and 7. 

Since 314 has factors other than 1 and itself, namely 2 and 7, it is not a prime number.

The factors of 831 are the numbers that divide it evenly. We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2.

831 divided by 2 is not an exact division, as the quotient is 415.5.

Since 831 is not divisible by 2, let's try the next prime number, which is 3.

831 divided by 3 is also not an exact division, with a quotient of 277.

Next, we try dividing by 5.

831 divided by 5 is still not an exact division, with a quotient of 166.2.

Continuing this process, we try dividing by 7.

831 divided by 7 is an exact division, with a quotient of 119.

To determine whether 358 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by finding the factors of 358. The factors of 358 can be obtained by dividing it by various numbers and checking if the division is exact (without any remainder). 

However, instead of checking all numbers, we can use the fact that all factors of a number will be less than or equal to its square root. 

So, let's find the square root of 358. The square root of 358 is approximately 18.94. 

Now we need to check if there are any factors of 358 between 2 and 18 (inclusive). 

By checking the divisions, we can see that 358 is divisible by 2 and 179. 

Since 2 and 179 are the only factors of 358 other than 1 and 358, we can conclude that 358 is a composite number.

2 ¡¿ 439 = 878
19 ¡¿ 46 = 878

To determine if 879 is a prime number, we will check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check for divisibility by 2
879 is not divisible by 2 because it ends in an odd number.

Step 2: Check for divisibility by 3

To determine if 879 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors besides 1 and itself.

We can start by checking if 879 is divisible by 2. If it is, then 879 is not a prime number and therefore a composite number. If it is not divisible by 2, we can continue to check for divisibility by other primes.

When we divide 879 by 2, we get the quotient 439.5. Since the quotient is not a whole number, we can conclude that 879 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if 879 is divisible by 3. When we divide 879 by 3, we get the quotient 293, which is also not a whole number.

Continuing this process, we can check for divisibility by 5, 7, 11, and so on. However, since 879 is not divisible by 2 or 3, it is unlikely to be divisible by other small primes.

Therefore, we can conclude that 879 is a composite number since it has factors other than 1 and itself.

Let's start by finding the factors of 886:

1 x 886 = 886
2 x 443 = 886

To determine if 889 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

Let's start by checking if it is divisible by 2, the smallest prime number. In this case, 889 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we sum its digits: 8 + 8 + 9 = 25. Since 25 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 889 is also not divisible by 3. 

Now, let's check if it is divisible by 5. Since 889 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. 

Continuing in this manner, we could check if it is divisible by 7, but it is evident that 889 is not divisible by 7. 

We could continue checking divisibility by other prime numbers, but in this case, it is unnecessary. 

Therefore, based on the above analysis, we can conclude that 889 is not a prime number, as it has factors other than 1 and itself.

We know that 381 is divisible by 1 and 381 itself. Now, let's check if it has any other factors.

To do that, we can start by dividing 381 by 2. If 381 is divisible by 2, then it is not a prime number and is therefore a composite number. 

When we divide 381 by 2, we get a quotient of 190.5, which is not a whole number. Hence, 381 is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check divisibility by 3. If 381 is divisible by 3, then again it is not a prime number and is therefore a composite number.

When we divide 381 by 3, we get a quotient of 127, which is a whole number. Hence, 381 is divisible by 3.

We can start by finding the factors of 382 by dividing it by numbers starting from 2 up to the square root of 382 (which is approximately 19.54).

Using this method, we find that 382 divided by 2 is 191 with a remainder of 0. Therefore, 2 is a factor of 382.

Since 447.5 is not a whole number, 2 is not a factor of 895. 

Next, let's try dividing it by 3:

Again, 3 does not evenly divide 895.

We can continue this process with other prime numbers, but let's skip ahead and divide it by 5:

Next, we can try dividing by 3. 669 divided by 3 gives 223, which is also not a whole number. 

We can then try dividing by 5, but 669 divided by 5 also does not yield a whole number. 

We can continue this process until we reach the square root of 669, which is approximately 25.88. 

Upon checking 669's divisibility by numbers up to 23, we find that it is not divisible by any of them. 

Therefore, we can conclude that 669 is a composite number.

To determine if 899 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by finding the square root of 899, which is approximately 29.9833.

Next, we can check if any numbers between 2 and 29 divide 899 without any remainder. If we find such a number, then 899 is composite.

Testing the divisibility of 899 by numbers from 2 to 29, we find that it is divisible by 29, since 29 multiplied by 31 equals 899.

Thus, 899 is not prime and is a composite number since it has a factor other than 1 and itself.

901_Q2,Q2,"
To check if 901 is a prime number, we need to test if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

We can start by dividing 901 by 2, the smallest prime number. If 901 is divisible by 2, then it is not a prime number.

901 ¡À 2 = 450 remainder 1

Since there is a remainder of 1, we can safely say that 901 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can continue testing divisibility by odd numbers up to the square root of 901, which is approximately 30 (since ??01 ??30.03).

Testing divisibility by odd numbers greater than 3:

901 ¡À 3 = 300 remainder 1
901 ¡À 5 = 180 remainder 1
901 ¡À 7 = 128 remainder 5
901 ¡À 11 = 81 remainder 10
901 ¡À 13 = 69 remainder 10
901 ¡À 17 = 53 remainder 0

Here we can observe that 901 is divisible by 17 without any remainder. Therefore, we can conclude that 901 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 17 in addition to 1 and itself.

Let's check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root. The square root of 391 is approximately 19.8.

We can start by checking division by the prime numbers less than or equal to 19: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19.

When we divide 391 by 2, we get a remainder of 1.
When we divide 391 by 3, we get a remainder of 1.
When we divide 391 by 5, we get a remainder of 1.
When we divide 391 by 7, we get a remainder of 0.

Therefore, 391 is divisible by 7, which means it is not a prime number.

Conclusion:
391 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 7.

To determine if 781 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. 

Checking for divisibility, we can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If the last digit of 781 is even, then it is divisible by 2. However, the last digit of 781 is 1, which is odd. So 781 is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if 781 is divisible by 3. To do this, we can sum its digits and check if the sum is divisible by 3. Adding 7 + 8 + 1 gives us 16, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 781 is not divisible by 3. 

We can continue this process for other primes like 5, 7, etc., but it is unnecessary because we can already conclude that 781 is not divisible by the smaller primes. 

Therefore, 781 is considered a composite number, not a prime number.

Next, we can check if any numbers between 2 and 30 divide evenly into 913. 

By checking these numbers, we find that 913 can be evenly divided by 11 and 83.

To determine if 533 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

Starting with the smallest possible divisor, we divide 533 by 2. If 533 is divisible by 2, then it is not a prime number.

533 ¡À 2 = 266 with a remainder of 1

Since we have a remainder, 2 is not a divisor of 533. We continue to the next possible divisor, which is 3.

533 ¡À 3 = 177 with a remainder of 2

Again, we have a remainder, so 3 is not a divisor of 533. We continue this process until we reach the square root of 533 or find a divisor.

Next, we try 4:

533 ¡À 4 = 133 with a remainder of 1

4 is not a divisor of 533. We continue testing with 5:

533 ¡À 5 = 106 with a remainder of 3

Again, we have a remainder, so 5 is not a divisor of 533. We continue testing until we reach the square root of 533:

533 ¡À 6 = 88 with a remainder of 5
533 ¡À 7 = 76 with a remainder of 5
533 ¡À 8 = 66 with a remainder of 5
533 ¡À 9 = 59 with a remainder of 8

At this point, we have found a divisor of 533 (13), which means 533 is a composite number.

To determine if 923 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. We can do this by finding its prime factorization.

To find the prime factorization of 923, we can start by dividing it by the smallest prime numbers and continue dividing until we obtain a quotient of 1.

923 is not divisible by 2, as it is an odd number.

Dividing 923 by 3, we get: 923 ¡À 3 = 307.67

Since the result is not a whole number, we move on to the next prime number.

Dividing 923 by 5, we get: 923 ¡À 5 = 184.6

Again, the result is not a whole number, so we continue.

Dividing 923 by 7, we get: 923 ¡À 7 = 131.86

Once more, the result is not a whole number.

Dividing 923 by 11, we get: 923 ¡À 11 = 83.909

The quotient is still not a whole number.

Dividing 923 by 13, we get: 923 ¡À 13 = 71

Finally, we have obtained a whole number as the quotient.

Therefore, the prime factorization of 923 is 13 ¡¿ 71.

To find the factors of 671, we can divide it by prime numbers starting from 2 and going up to the square root of the number.

If we divide 671 by 2, we get a quotient of 335.5, which is not an integer. Similarly, if we divide 671 by 3, 4, 5, or any other prime number, we would not obtain an integer quotient.

However, when we divide 671 by 11, we get a quotient of 61, which is an integer. Therefore, 11 is a factor of 671.

949_Q2,Q2,"
To determine if 949 is a prime number, we need to consider if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if 2 is a factor. If we divide 949 by 2, we get 474.5, which is not a whole number. Therefore, 2 is not a factor of 949.

Next, we can check if 3 is a factor. If we divide 949 by 3, we get 316.333, which is not a whole number. Therefore, 3 is not a factor of 949.

Continuing this process, we can check if 4, 5, 6, and so on, up to the square root of 949, are factors. 

Upon checking through this process, we find that 949 is divisible by 13. When we divide 949 by 13, we get 73, which is a whole number. Therefore, 949 is not a prime number since it has factors other than 1 and itself.

To determine if 697 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. The last digit of 697 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. By adding the digits of 697 (6 + 9 + 7 = 22), we see that 697 is not divisible by 3.

We can also check if it is divisible by 5. The last digit of 697 is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Continuing in this manner, we can check if it is divisible by 7. By applying the divisibility rule for 7 (subtract twice the last digit from the remaining digits), we get 69 - (2*7) = 69 - 14 = 55, which is divisible by 7. Therefore, 697 is divisible by 7.

Therefore, 697 has factors other than 1 and itself, making it a composite number.

To determine if 341 is a prime number, we first check if it's divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. We start by dividing it by 2, but 341 is not divisible by 2 because it's an odd number. 

Next, we check division by odd numbers starting from 3. When dividing 341 by 3, we find that it is not divisible evenly since 341 divided by 3 equals 113 remainder 2.

We continue this process by checking division with odd numbers up to the square root of 341, which is approximately 18.44. We find that 341 is not divisible evenly by any other odd number up to 18.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. Adding the digits of 611, we get 6 + 1 + 1 = 8. Since 8 is not divisible by 3, 611 is not divisible by 3.

Now, we can check if it is divisible by any other prime numbers up to the square root of 611, which is approximately 24.7.

Looking for prime numbers less than 24.7:

To determine if 869 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

Let's begin by checking if 869 is divisible by 2. If it is divisible by 2, then it cannot be prime, and hence composite.

869 divided by 2 is 434 with a remainder of 1.

Since 869 is not divisible by 2, let's check if it is divisible by the next prime number, which is 3.

869 divided by 3 is 289 with a remainder of 2.

Again, 869 is not divisible by 3. 

Let's continue checking divisibility by prime numbers.

To determine if 247 is a composite number, we need to determine if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can start by finding the prime factorization of 247.

The prime factorization is the process of breaking down the number into its prime factors, which are the prime numbers that can divide the number evenly.

We start by dividing 247 by the smallest prime number, 2. However, 247 is not divisible by 2 as it is an odd number.

We continue by dividing 247 by the next prime number, 3. We find that 247 divided by 3 is approximately 82 remainder 1.

Moving on, we try dividing 247 by the next prime number, 5. Again, it does not divide evenly.

Next, we check if 247 is divisible by 7. We find that 247 divided by 7 is approximately 35 remainder 2.

Continuing, we try 11 as a divisor. However, 247 is not divisible by 11.

Since we have checked all prime numbers up to the square root of 247 (which is approximately 15.7), and found no factors other than 1 and 247, we can conclude that 247 is a composite number.

Therefore, the answer is yes, 247 is a composite number.

To determine if 253 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can check all numbers starting from 2 up to the square root of 253 (which is approximately 15.92). If any of these numbers divide 253 without leaving a remainder, then it is a factor of 253.

Checking the divisors, we find that 253 can be divided evenly by 11: 
253 ¡À 11 = 23. 

So, 253 is divisible by 11, which means it has factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 253 is a composite number.

8485 is divisible by 5 because the last digit is 5.
To check the divisibility by 5, we can add the digits and check if the sum is divisible by 5.

To determine if 5354 is a prime number, we can proceed as follows:

1. Check divisibility by even numbers: Any number ending in an even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8) is divisible by 2. Since 5354 does end in an even digit, it is divisible by 2, and therefore not a prime number.

Therefore, 5354 is not a prime number.

In the case of 5354, we can divide it by 2, and we get 2677. 

Next, we can divide it by 3, but it is not divisible evenly. 

Further, we can continue checking divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 5354 (approximately 73.2). However, it is not necessary in this case because we have already found a factor of 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (3 + 2 + 7 + 3) is 15, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 3273 is divisible by 3.
Hence, 3273 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 3.

5818_Q2,Q2,"
To determine if 5818 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If a number is even and not equal to 2, it is not prime because it has 2 as a factor. 5818 is even, so it is divisible by 2.

5818 divided by 2 is 2909. Since 2909 is an odd number, we can check for divisibility by odd numbers starting from 3. 

Next, we can check for divisibility by 3. 5+8+1+8=22, and 22 is not divisible by 3, so 5818 is also not divisible by 3.

Since 5818 is not divisible by 2 or 3, we can continue checking for divisibility by odd numbers up to ??818, which is approximately 76.

Checking for divisibility by 5, we see that the last digit of 5818 is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Checking divisibility by 7, we can use the divisibility rule which states that we can subtract twice the units digit from the rest of the number. The result, 581 - (2*8) = 581 - 16 = 565, is not divisible by 7, so 5818 is not divisible by 7.

We can continue in this manner, checking divisibility by 11, 13, 17, 19, etc., but we can observe that 5818 is divisible by 2. Therefore, it is not a prime number.

Let's try dividing 1195 by 2. We find that 2 does not divide evenly into 1195.

Next, let's try dividing it by 3. Again, 3 does not divide evenly into 1195.

Continuing this process, let's try with 5. Dividing 1195 by 5 gives us a quotient of 239, which is a positive integer.

3849_Q2,Q2,"
To determine if 3849 is a prime number, we can use the divisibility test.

First, we know that all prime numbers greater than 2 are odd. So, if 3849 is divisible by 2, then it is not a prime number.

To check for divisibility by 2, we look at the units digit. In this case, the units digit of 3849 is 9, which is odd. Therefore, 3849 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if 3849 is divisible by any odd numbers up to the square root of 3849, which is approximately 62.

We start by checking divisibility by 3. We add up the digits of 3849: 3 + 8 + 4 + 9 = 24. Since 24 is divisible by 3, we know that 3849 is also divisible by 3.

Therefore, 3849 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 3.

Since 2 does not divide evenly into 3849, let's try the next number, 3:

To determine if 3891 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2. 
3891 is not even, so it is not divisible by 2.

Step 2: Check divisibility by odd numbers up to the square root of 3891. 
The square root of 3891 is approximately 62.39. We need to check divisibility by odd numbers up to 62.

3891 is not divisible by 3 (3 + 8 + 9 + 1 = 21, not divisible by 3).

Step 3: Continue checking divisibility by odd numbers.
3891 is not divisible by 5 (last digit is not 0 or 5).

Step 4: Check divisibility by 7. 
To check divisibility by 7, we can use the divisibility rule. Subtract twice the last digit (2 * 1 = 2) from the remaining truncated number (389 - 2 = 387), which results in 387. Repeating this process, we have 38 - 2 = 36, which is divisible by 7.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3 by summing its digits: 4 + 1 + 4 + 3 = 12. Since 12 is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 4143 is divisible by 3.

To determine if 4143 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. To do that, we can start finding the factors of 4143 by dividing it by various numbers.

First, we'll test if it's divisible by 2. 4143 is an odd number, so it's not divisible by 2.

Next, we'll test if it's divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 4143 is 4 + 1 + 4 + 3 = 12, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 4143 is divisible by 3.

We divide 4143 by 3, which gives us 4143 ¡À 3 = 1381. 

1381 is not divisible by 2 or 3. 

Now, we'll continue trying to divide it by larger prime numbers. 

We find it is not divisible by 5, 7, 11, or 13.

Next, we check if it's divisible by 17. 4143 ¡À 17 = 243. 

243 is divisible by 3, specifically 243 ¡À 3 = 81.

81 is also divisible by 3, 81 ¡À 3 = 27.

27 is divisible by 3, 27 ¡À 3 = 9.

9 is divisible by 3, 9 ¡À 3 = 3.

Finally, we reach 3, which is prime and cannot be divided any further.

Since 4143 can be divided by 3 multiple times before reaching a prime number, we can conclude that 4143 is a composite number.

To do this, we can start by checking if 9634 is divisible by prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 9634.

The square root of 9634 is approximately 98.15, so we only need to check divisibility by prime numbers up to 98.

Starting with the lowest prime number, which is 2, we can see that 9634 is not divisible by 2 as it is an odd number.

Next, we check divisibility by 3. The sum of its digits, 9 + 6 + 3 + 4, is equal to 22, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 9634 is not divisible by 3.

We continue checking divisibility by prime numbers up to 98, but since 9634 is not divisible by 2 or 3, it is highly unlikely to be divisible by any other prime numbers less than 98.

Therefore, we can conclude that 9634 is a composite number, as it is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 9634.

To determine if 8185 is a prime number, we need to test its divisibility by prime numbers less than its square root (approximately 90).

First, we check if 8185 is divisible by 2. If the number ends with an even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), it is divisible by 2. However, 8185 ends with an odd digit (5), so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check for divisibility by 3. To do this, we sum the individual digits of 8185: 8 + 1 + 8 + 5 = 22. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, neither is 8185.

Now, we test divisibility by 5. If the number ends with 0 or 5, it is divisible by 5. However, 8185 does not end with 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

To continue verifying if 8185 is prime, we can check divisibility by prime numbers greater than 5, such as 7, 11, 13, and so on. However, these divisibility tests can become cumbersome and time-consuming, especially for larger numbers like 8185.

Dividing 3561 by 2 gives a result of 1780.5, which means that 2 is not a factor of 3561. 

We can continue the process by trying other numbers. We can check if 3 divides into 3561. 

If we add up the digits of 3561 (3 + 5 + 6 + 1), we get 15. Since 15 is divisible by 3 (3 * 5 = 15), 3561 is also divisible by 3. 

Dividing 3561 by 3 gives a result of 1187. 

We continue the process by dividing 3561 by other numbers, but let's quickly check if it is divisible by 4. 

For a number to be divisible by 4, its last two digits must form a number that is divisible by 4. The last two digits of 3561 are 61, and since 61 is not divisible by 4, we know that 3561 is not divisible by 4.

Finally, we can check if it is divisible by any numbers up to the square root of 8735. However, this can be time-consuming. So, let's look at a faster approach. 

We could factorize 8735 into its prime factors. Once we find any prime factors, we know that the number is not prime. 

8735 is divisible by 5 because it ends in 5. Dividing 8735 by 5 gives us 1747. 

Now, we need to check if 1747 is a prime number. Again, we can check if it is divisible by any numbers up to its square root, but it would be quicker to factorize it. However, we will find that 1747 is a prime number. 

Therefore, since 8735 has a factor other than 1 and itself (5), it is not a prime number.

To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can start by identifying the factors of 9194. 

The factors of 9194 can be found by dividing it by all numbers from 1 up to the square root of 9194, and checking if the division leaves a remainder of 0. 

We can start the process by checking division by 2. 

9194 ¡À 2 = 4597, remainder 0

So, 2 is a factor of 9194. 

Next, we can check division by 3. 

9194 ¡À 3 = 3064.6666 (approximately), remainder 2

So 3 is not a factor of 9194. 

We can continue this process and check division by other numbers. However, for efficiency, we can also notice that if a number is not divisible by 3, then it is not divisible by any multiple or sum of 3 (e.g. 6, 9, 12, etc.). 

Therefore, we can conclude that the factors of 9194 are not divisible by numbers larger than 3. 

Since 9194 has factors other than 1 and itself, it is a composite number.

",composite,composite,4_digit_easy_composite,6905,5,1381,correct
6905_Q4,Q4,"
To determine if 6905 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by finding the prime factors of 6905. We can divide it by a prime number, starting with 2:

6905 ¡À 2 = 3452.5

The result is not a whole number. Hence, 2 is not a factor of 6905.

Next, we try dividing it by 3:

6905 ¡À 3 = 2301.666...

Again, the result is not a whole number. Therefore, 3 is also not a factor of 6905.

Continuing this process, we can divide 6905 by 5:

6905 ¡À 5 = 1381

The result is a whole number. Therefore, 5 is a factor of 6905.

Now we check if there are any other prime factors between 5 and the square root of 6905. If we continue dividing by larger prime numbers, we find that 6905 is divisible by 29:

6905 ¡À 29 = 238.448...

Since the result is not a whole number, we know that 29 is a factor of 6905.

Therefore, the prime factorization of 6905 is 5 ¡¿ 29.

Since 6905 has factors other than 1 and itself, namely 5 and 29, it is a composite number.

To determine if 1355 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

The first step is to find the prime factors of 1355. We can start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2. 

1355 ¡À 2 = 677.5

Since 677.5 is not an integer, 2 is not a factor of 1355. We move on to the next prime number, which is 3.

1355 ¡À 3 = 451.666

Again, 451.666 is not an integer, so 3 is not a factor of 1355. We continue with 5.

1355 ¡À 5 = 271

5 is a factor of 1355, and the quotient is an integer. So, 1355 is divisible by 5. 

Now, we check if there are any factors other than 1, 1355 and 5. Since we have only found 2 factors, it means that 1355 is a composite number.

Therefore, the answer is yes, 1355 is a composite number.

To determine if 5979 is a prime number, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

Step 1: Check if the number is divisible by 2.
The last digit of 5979 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.

Step 2: Check if the number is divisible by 3.
To determine if a number is divisible by 3, we sum up its digits and check if that sum is divisible by 3.
5 + 9 + 7 + 9 = 30. Since 30 is divisible by 3, 5979 is also divisible by 3.

Since 5979 is divisible by 3, it is not a prime number.

Since 5374 is divisible by 2, we can divide it by 2:

5374 ¡À 2 = 2687

We now have the result of the division as 2687. 

Next, we can check if 2687 is divisible by any prime numbers greater than 2. To do this, we can check divisibility up to the square root of 2687, which is approximately 51.83 (rounded up to 52).

We can start checking divisibility by prime numbers greater than 2 in increasing order. 

Checking if 2687 is divisible by 3: 
Sum the digits of 2687: 2 + 6 + 8 + 7 = 23
Since 23 is not divisible by 3, 2687 is not divisible by 3.

Checking if 2687 is divisible by 5: 
The last digit of 2687 is not a 0 or 5, so 2687 is not divisible by 5.

Checking if 2687 is divisible by 7: 
Removing the last digit (7) and subtracting twice this value from the remaining digits (268 - 2*7 = 254):
254 is not divisible by 7.

Since we have checked up to the square root of 2687 and found no other factors, we can conclude that 5374 is a composite number.

The square root of 3693 is approximately 60.8, so we can start checking divisibility by prime numbers up to 60.

We start by checking if 3693 is divisible by 2. Since it is not an even number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check if it is divisible by 3, which is the next prime number. To do this, we sum the digits of 3693: 3 + 6 + 9 + 3 = 21. Since 21 is not divisible by 3, 3693 is not divisible by 3.

5294_Q2,Q2,"
To determine if 5294 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can perform a simple divisibility test by dividing 5294 by all integers from 2 to the square root of 5294 (approximately 72.74). 

If at any point the division is exact, i.e., no remainder is left, then 5294 is not a prime number. Otherwise, if no exact division occurs up to the square root of 5294, then 5294 is a prime number. 

Now, let's perform the divisibility test: 

5294 ¡À 2 = 2647 remainder 0 (not a prime number) 

Therefore, 5294 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 2 without any remainder.

Next, we can try dividing by 3. By summing the digits of 5294, we have 5 + 2 + 9 + 4 = 20. Since 20 is not divisible by 3, 5294 is also not divisible by 3. 

Now, we can check if 5294 is divisible by any number greater than 3 and less than its square root, which is approximately 72.71. We find that 5294 is divisible by 59, as 59 x 89 = 5261.

To determine if 8553 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, let's check if it is divisible by 2. Since 8553 is an odd number (ends with 3), it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we can add all the digits of 8553 together: 8 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 21. Since 21 is divisible by 3, 8553 is also divisible by 3.

Therefore, 8553 is not a prime number since it is divisible by 3.

Step 1: Find the factors of 8553
The factors of 8553 are the numbers that divide evenly into 8553. We can use divisibility tests or perform trial division to find the factors.

Starting with the number 2, we can check if it evenly divides 8553. If it does, then 2 is a factor.

8553 ¡À 2 = 4276 remainder 1

Since 2 does not divide evenly into 8553, we can move on to the next number, which is 3.

8553 ¡À 3 = 2851 remainder 0

So, 3 is a factor of 8553.

Step 2: Check for factors beyond 3
We can continue with trial division or use a more efficient method, such as checking divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 8553. However, since we have already found a factor of 3, we know that 8553 is not a prime number.

Therefore, 8553 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.

Since 183 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to its square root, we can stop the division process.

Therefore, the prime factorization of 6238 is 2 x 17 x 183.

A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that can be divided evenly (without leaving a remainder) by at least one positive integer other than 1 or itself. In other words, a composite number has more than two distinct positive divisors. 

Now, let's see if 9098 is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

To identify such divisors, we can start dividing 9098 by numbers from 2 to the square root of 9098 and check if any divisions result in an even quotient.

Therefore, 6145 can be written as 5 ¡¿ 1229.

Since 1229 is a prime number (it cannot be further divided without getting a decimal), we can conclude that both 5 and 1229 are factors of 6145.

Now let's check if 6638 is divisible by prime numbers up to 81. Starting with the smallest prime number, 2, we divide 6638 by 2:

So, we have found that 6638 is divisible by 2.

Since 3319 is a prime number, we cannot continue factoring.

To determine if 1822 is a prime number, we will check if it is divisible by any prime numbers from 2 up to its square root.

First, we check if 1822 is divisible by 2. The last digit of 1822 is even, which means it is divisible by 2.

1822 ¡À 2 = 911

911 is an odd number, so we continue to check if it is divisible by any other prime numbers.

Next, we check if 911 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits is 9 + 1 + 1 = 11, which is not divisible by 3.

Next, we check if 911 is divisible by 5. The last digit of 911 is not a 0 or a 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Next, we check if 911 is divisible by 7. There is no obvious pattern or divisibility rule, so we can divide it manually to check if it evenly divides.

911 ¡À 7 = 130 remainder 1

Since 911 leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 7, it is not divisible by 7.

Next, we check if 911 is divisible by 11. The difference between the sum of the forward digits and the sum of the backward digits is 11 - 1 = 10. Since 10 is not divisible by 11, 911 is not divisible by 11.

Since we have checked prime numbers up to the square root of 911 (which is approximately 30), and 911 is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 911 is a prime number.

Therefore, 1822 is not a prime number.

To determine if 8187 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Now, the first step is to find the factors of 8187:

8187 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

We can perform a quick divisibility test for 3 by checking if the sum of the digits of 8187 is divisible by 3:

8 + 1 + 8 + 7 = 24

Since 24 is divisible by 3, we know that 8187 is divisible by 3.

8187 ¡À 3 = 2729

So, we have found one factor: 3.

Now, let's check if 8187 is divisible by any numbers between 3 and the square root of 8187. We can stop at the square root because any factors after that will already have corresponding factors below the square root.

The square root of 8187 is approximately 90.5.

We can start testing for divisibility by checking the prime numbers up to the square root of 8187:

5: 8187 is not divisible by 5.
7: 8187 is not divisible by 7.
11: 8187 is not divisible by 11.
13: 8187 is not divisible by 13.
17: 8187 is not divisible by 17.
19: 8187 is not divisible by 19.
23: 8187 is not divisible by 23.

We can see that we haven't found any more factors for 8187.

Therefore, we conclude that 8187 is a composite number since it has factors other than 1 and itself. In this case, the factor we found is 3.

To determine if 4358 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.
The square root of 4358 is approximately 65.98, so we only need to check divisibility by prime numbers up to 65.

We can check if 4358 is divisible by prime numbers 2, 3, 5, and so on, up to 65.

Starting with 2: 4358 % 2 = 0 (The remainder is zero), so 4358 is divisible by 2 and is therefore not a prime number.

4358_Q4,Q4,"
To determine whether a number is composite or not, we need to first understand the definition of a composite number.

A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or the number itself. In other words, a composite number has factors other than 1 and itself.

To check if the number 4358 is composite, we need to test if it has any divisors other than 1 and 4358.

Starting with the divisors of 2, we can see that 4358 is even because its units digit is even (8). So, 2 is a divisor of 4358.

To further investigate if there are any more divisors, we can perform a prime factorization of the number. 

Dividing 4358 by 2, we get 2179. 

Now, we continue to factorize 2179. Dividing it by 2 and all other primes, we find that there are no more factors.

Therefore, we conclude that 4358 is a composite number, as it has divisors other than 1 and the number itself.

To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 
To do this, we can start by finding the prime factors of 4449. 

We can divide 4449 by 2, but it is not divisible evenly: 
4449 ¡À 2 = 2224 remainder 1

Next, we can try dividing by 3:
4449 ¡À 3 = 1483 remainder 0

We have found a factor. So, 3 is a prime factor of 4449.

Now we can divide 4449 by 3:

To determine if 7235 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If the number ends in an even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), it is divisible by 2. Since 7235 ends in 5, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 7235 is 7 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 17, which is not divisible by 3.

Then, we can check if it is divisible by 5. As mentioned earlier, if the number ends in 5 or 0, then it is divisible by 5. Since 7235 ends in 5, it is divisible by 5.

To determine whether 6995 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we check if it is divisible by 2. Since 6995 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can move on to the next prime number, which is 3.

To check if 6995 is divisible by 3, we sum its digits: 6 + 9 + 9 + 5 = 29. Since 29 is not divisible by 3, 6995 is also not divisible by 3.

Next, we check if it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit of 6995 is 5, it is divisible by 5.

Therefore, 6995 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 5.

To determine if 5637 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we observe that 5637 is an odd number. Composite numbers can be odd or even, so this information does not help us determine its nature.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root (rounded up). The square root of 5637 is approximately 75.07.

Starting with the smallest prime number, 2, we find that 5637 is not divisible by 2. 
We move on to the next prime number, 3. If we sum the digits of 5637, we get 5+6+3+7 = 21. Since 21 is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 5637 is also divisible by 3.

Further dividing 5637 by 3, we get 5637 ¡À 3 = 1879, which is not a prime number but rather a whole number greater than 1.

As a result, 5637 is indeed a composite number since it has factors other than 1 and itself (3 and 1879).

To determine if 2798 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Find the factors of 2798

To find the factors of 2798, we can start by dividing it by 2, as it is an even number.

2798 ¡À 2 = 1399

As the result is not a whole number, 2 is not a factor of 2798. So, we continue by trying the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

2798 ¡À 3 ??933 (not a whole number)

Now, let's try dividing by 5.

2798 ¡À 5 ??559.6 (not a whole number)

Observing the pattern, we notice that the number ends with 8, which is divisible by 2. So, let's try dividing by 2 again.

2798 ¡À 2 = 1399

This time, the result is a whole number. Therefore, we have found a factor: 2.

Step 2: Check for any additional factors

Now that we have found one factor, 2, let's continue dividing 1399 to check for any additional factors.

1399 ¡À 2 ??699.5 (not a whole number)

Indeed, 1385 is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if 1385 is divisible by 3. If it is, then it is not a prime number.

Adding up the digits of 1385, we get 1 + 3 + 8 + 5 = 17, which is not divisible by 3. 

Moving on, we can check if 1385 is divisible by 5. If it is, then it is not a prime number.

Again, 1385 is not divisible by 5.

Next, we can check for divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 1561. The square root of 1561 is approximately 39.49.

Starting with the number 3, we can check if 1561 is divisible by any odd numbers up to 39.49. 

1561 ¡À 3 = 520 remainder 1
1561 ¡À 5 = 312 remainder 1

Since we have a remainder, 2 is not a factor of 4971. Next, we can check the next prime number, 3.

If we divide 4971 by 3, we get a quotient of 1657 with a remainder of 0.

Since we do not have a remainder, 3 is a factor of 4971.

Therefore, we have found at least two factors of 4971 (3 and 1657) other than 1 and itself (4971). Therefore, 4971 is a composite number.

To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Find the factors of 6879. We can do this by finding all the numbers that divide evenly into 6879. 

One approach is to divide 6879 by integers starting from 2, and see if any of them give a remainder of 0. If any do, then we know 6879 is not a prime number.

Let's try dividing by 2:
6879 ¡À 2 = 3439 with a remainder of 1

Next, let's try dividing by 3:

So, we see that 3 is a factor of 6879.

Step 2: Determine if there are any other factors of 6879. We can continue dividing the number by different integers greater than 3 to check for any additional factors.

If we continue dividing by 4, 5, 6, etc., we won't find any more factors because the next few integers (4, 5, 6) are greater than 2293. So, we can conclude that 3 is the only factor other than 1 and 6879.

To do this, we can try to find any factors by finding pairs of numbers that multiply together to give 8318.

However, it can be time-consuming to check every number individually, so we can use some techniques to make the process more efficient.

The first thing we can do is check if 8318 is divisible by 2. If the last digit of a number is divisible by 2 (i.e., it is even), then the whole number is divisible by 2. In this case, the last digit of 8318 is 8, which is divisible by 2, so 8318 is divisible by 2.

Dividing 8318 by 2 gives us 4159. 

Now let's see if 4159 has any factors. We can check if it is divisible by small primes, such as 3 and 5.

The sum of the digits of 4159 is 4 + 1 + 5 + 9 = 19, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 4159 is not divisible by 3.

The last digit of 4159 is 9, which is not divisible by 2 or 5. So, 4159 is not divisible by 2 or 5.

Since we haven't found any factors of 4159, we can conclude that 8318 is a composite number.

Step 1: Find the factors of 2823
The factors of 2823 are the numbers that divide it without leaving a remainder. We can find these factors by checking for divisibility.

Checking divisibility by 2: 2823 is not divisible by 2 because the last digit is 3, which is odd.

Checking divisibility by 3: To check for divisibility by 3, we add up the digits of 2823 and see if the sum is divisible by 3. 
2 + 8 + 2 + 3 = 15. Since 15 is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 2823 is divisible by 3.

Therefore, we have found a factor of 2823, which is 3. We can also find the other factor by dividing 2823 by 3:
2823 ¡À 3 = 941.

So, the factors of 2823 are 3 and 941.

To determine if 4911 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking if 4911 is divisible by 2. Since 4911 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if 4911 is divisible by any odd number up to its square root, which is approximately 70.12. 

Starting with 3, we check if 4911 is divisible by 3. By adding up the digits, 4 + 9 + 1 + 1 equals 15, which is divisible by 3. Hence, 4911 is divisible by 3.

To do this, we can start by finding the factors of 1285:

1 x 1285 = 1285
5 x 257 = 1285

Since 1285 has more than two factors (1, 5, 257, and 1285), it is a composite number.

1149_Q2,Q2,"
To determine if 1149 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If the last digit of a number is even (i.e., 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), then the number itself is divisible by 2. Since the last digit of 1149 is 9, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we can sum the digits of the number. The sum of the digits of 1149 is 1 + 1 + 4 + 9 = 15, which is not divisible by 3.

Since it is not divisible by 2 or 3, we can continue checking for other divisors. However, we can also use a quicker method by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers up to its square root. 

The square root of 1149 is approximately 33.91. We can check divisibility by prime numbers up to 33.

Upon checking, we find that 1149 is divisible by 3 and 383, as 3 * 383 = 1149.

Upon conducting the division checks, we find that 1149 can be evenly divided by 3:

- 1149 ¡À 3 = 383

Since 1149 has a factor other than 1 and itself (in this case, 3), it is considered a composite number.

To determine if 8691 is a prime number, we can use a method called trial division. We will check if 8691 is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

First, we find the square root of 8691, which is approximately 93.27.

Next, we check if 8691 is divisible by any prime numbers less than 93.27. We start with 2 and find that 8691 is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we check if 8691 is divisible by 3. By summing up the digits of 8691: 8 + 6 + 9 + 1 = 24, we determine that 8691 is divisible by 3 since 24 is divisible by 3. 

Therefore, 8691 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 3.

To determine if 8691 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors besides 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If the digits in the number add up to a multiple of 3, then the number itself is divisible by 3. If the last digits are 0 or 5, then the number is divisible by 5. 

Let's calculate the sum of the digits in 8691:
8 + 6 + 9 + 1 = 24

Since 24 is not a multiple of 3, 8691 is not divisible by 3.

The number 8691 does not end with 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Since it is not divisible by either 2, 3, or 5, we can conclude that 8691 is a composite number.

To determine if 5645 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since the number ends in 5, it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we can add the individual digits of the number and check if the sum is divisible by 3. 

5 + 6 + 4 + 5 = 20

Since 20 is not divisible by 3, 5645 is not divisible by 3. 

We can continue this process with other prime numbers, such as 5 and 7, but it may take some time. 

Alternatively, we can use a calculator or a computer program to determine if 5645 has any factors. In this case, we find that 5645 is divisible by 5 and 1129. 

Therefore, 5645 is not a prime number as it has factors other than 1 and itself.

To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has more than two factors. 

First, we find the factors of 5645. We start by dividing it by 2, but since 2 does not evenly divide into 5645, we move on to the next number, which is 3. Again, 3 does not divide evenly into 5645. 

Next, we try the next prime number, which is 5. Dividing 5645 by 5 yields 1129, which is a whole number. 

Therefore, we have found one factor pair: 5 and 1129.

To do this, we can consider factors of 2018. 

1. We know that 2018 is an even number because it ends with the digit 8, so it is divisible by 2. 
   Therefore, we can immediately conclude that 2018 is not a prime number. 

Additionally, we can find other factors of 2018 to verify this:
2. 2018 divided by 2 equals 1009, which is a prime number.

To determine if 8067 is a prime number, we will analyze its factors. 
First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If a number ends in an even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), it is divisible by 2. However, 8067 does not end in an even digit, so it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 8067 is 8 + 0 + 6 + 7 = 21. If the sum is divisible by three, then the number is also divisible by three. Since 21 is divisible by 3, 8067 is divisible by 3.

Step 2: Check all numbers from 2 to the square root of 8746 (i.e., 2 to 93) to see if any of them divide 8746 without leaving a remainder.

By checking the divisibility of 8746 with all the numbers from 2 to 93, we find that 8746 is divisible by 2, 61, and 71.

To determine if 8746 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

First, let's find the prime factors of 8746. We can start by dividing it by 2, as it is an even number:

8746 ¡À 2 = 4373.

Since 4373 is not divisible by 2, we need to divide it by the next prime number, 3:

4373 ¡À 3 = 1457.67.

Again, 1457.67 is not a whole number, so we try the next prime number, 5:

4373 ¡À 5 = 874.6.

Once more, 874.6 is not an integer, so we move on to 7, the next prime number:

4373 ¡À 7 = 624.71.

624.71 is not a whole number either, so we test division by 11:

4373 ¡À 11 = 397.55.

Even though 397.55 is not an integer, we can see that we've already covered prime numbers up to 11. Therefore, there are no more prime factors to check, and we can conclude that 8746 is a composite number.

It can be expressed as the product of smaller whole numbers: 2 ¡¿ 4373 = 8746.

To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can start by checking if 3578 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to its square root (since the factors always come in pairs, and the larger factor would be greater than the square root). 

Taking the square root of 3578 gives us approximately 59.82, so we only need to check prime numbers up to 59. 

We can start with 2 and continue checking if 3578 is divisible by prime numbers up to 59. 

Upon checking, we find that 3578 is divisible by 2, since 3578 divided by 2 equals 1789.

To determine if 1795 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors besides 1 and itself. 
We can begin by finding the prime factors of 1795. 

To do this, we can divide 1795 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. If 1795 is divisible by 2, we continue dividing until we can no longer divide evenly. 

However, 1795 is not divisible by 2 since it is an odd number. 

Next, we try dividing by the next prime number, which is 3. 

When we divide 1795 by 3, we get a quotient of 598 remainder 1. 

We can continue dividing by the prime numbers 5, 7, 11, and so on, until we reach a point where the quotient is less than the divisor and we cannot proceed further. 

Following this procedure, we find that the prime factorization of 1795 is 5 x 359.

To determine if 4863 is a composite number, we need to check if it can be divided by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit (3) is odd, 4863 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of all the digits in 4863 is 4 + 8 + 6 + 3 = 21, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 4863 is divisible by 3.

Further, we can check if it is divisible by 5. 4863 does not end with 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Continuing, we can check if it is divisible by 7. By applying the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit (6) from the remaining leading digits (486) which gives us 486 - 6 * 2 = 486 - 12 = 474. This process can be repeated for 474, and we get 477 - 14 = 463. Again, we repeat the process to get 46 - 3 * 2 = 40. Since 40 is divisible by 7, 4863 is divisible by 7.

Lastly, we can check if it is divisible by 11. By applying the divisibility rule for 11, we subtract the last digit (3) from the remaining leading digits (486) which gives us 486 - 3 = 483. Since 483 is not divisible by 11, 4863 is not divisible by 11.

Dividing 1831 by 3 does not give an integer result.

Dividing 1831 by 5 does not give an integer result.

Dividing 1831 by 7 gives 261, which is a whole number. So 7 is a factor.

Lastly, we divide 261 by prime numbers:

Dividing 261 by 2 does not give an integer result.

Dividing 261 by 3 gives 87, which is a whole number. So 3 is a factor.

Dividing 87 by prime numbers:

4262_Q4,Q4,"
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it can be divided evenly by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, let's check if 4262 is divisible by 2 by checking if the last digit is even. Since the last digit of 4262 is 2, which is even, it is divisible by 2.

To confirm, we can calculate 4262 ¡À 2 = 2131. 

Since the result is not a whole number, we can conclude that 4262 is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check if 4262 is divisible by 3. We can do this by adding the digits together and checking if the sum is divisible by 3. 

4 + 2 + 6 + 2 = 14

Since 14 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 4262 is not divisible by 3.

So far, we have determined that 4262 is not divisible by 2 or 3. 

Let's continue checking if it is divisible by other prime numbers:

- 5: 4262 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
- 7: By dividing 4262 by 7, we get 608 remainder 6. Since the remainder is not 0, it is not divisible by 7.
- 11: By using the alternating sum method (subtracting the last digit from the remaining number), we get 4 - 2 + 6 - 2 = 6. Since 6 is not divisible by 11, 4262 is not divisible by 11.

Since we have checked the divisibility of 4262 by prime numbers up to 11 and it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 4262 is a composite number.

2735_Q2,Q2,"
To determine if 2735 is a prime number, we can follow these steps:

1. Check for divisibility by 2: Since 2735 is odd (not divisible by 2), we can rule out it being a prime number.

2. Check for divisibility by odd numbers up to the square root of 2735: The square root of 2735 is approximately 52.33. We can check for divisibility by odd numbers up to 53.

After conducting the divisibility test, we find that 2735 is divisible by 5 since it ends with the digit 5. Therefore, it is not a prime number.

To determine if 2735 is a composite number, we should begin by checking if it is divisible by any integers other than 1 and itself.

First, let's find the prime factors of 2735.
We start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2.
2735 ¡À 2 = 1367.5

Since 1367.5 is not an integer, we can conclude that 2 is not a factor of 2735.

Next, we move on to the next prime number, which is 3.
2735 ¡À 3 = 911.67

Again, 911.67 is not an integer, meaning that 3 is also not a factor of 2735.

Continuing in this manner, we divide 2735 by the next prime number, which is 5.
2735 ¡À 5 = 547

Since 547 is an integer, we have found a factor of 2735.

So far, we have found that 2735 is divisible by 5, and therefore it is not a prime number. Thus, 2735 is a composite number.

Next, we check if 4555 is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 4555 is 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 19. Since 19 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 4555 is not divisible by 3.

Now, we check if 4555 is divisible by 5. Since the last digit is 5, which is divisible by 5, we can conclude that 4555 is divisible by 5.

Therefore, 4555 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 5.

To determine if a number is composite, we check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

In this case, we can start by checking if 4555 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can move on to checking if it is divisible by 3. Adding up the digits of 4555: 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 19. Since 19 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 4555 is not divisible by 3. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 5. The last digit of 4555 is 5, which means it is divisible by 5. 

Therefore, 4555 is divisible by both 5 and 911 (since 4555 divided by 5 is 911). We have found two factors, other than 1 and itself, which makes it a composite number.

2315_Q2,Q2,"
To determine if 2315 is a prime number, we would need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself.

First, we can check if 2 divides evenly into 2315. If the number is even, it is not prime. However, 2 does not divide evenly into 2315.

Next, we can check if 3 divides evenly into 2315. The sum of the digits of 2315 is 2 + 3 + 1 + 5 = 11, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 3 does not divide evenly into 2315.

We can also check if 5 divides evenly into 2315 by looking at the last digit. If the last digit is 0 or 5, then the entire number is divisible by 5. However, the last digit of 2315 is 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

We can continue this process by checking if it is divisible by 7, 11, and other prime numbers. However, a more efficient approach would be to use a calculator or software that can quickly determine if a number is prime or not.

In this case, 2315 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 5.

Let's start checking the numbers:
2 does not divide 2315, so it is not a factor.
3 does not divide 2315.
4 does not divide 2315.
5 divides 2315, as 2315 divided by 5 is 463 with no remainder. Therefore, 2315 is a composite number.

So, yes, 2315 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself (for example, 5 and 463).

To determine if 1389 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If a number is divisible by 2, then it is not a prime number. 

1389 is not an even number, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. If the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 3, then the number itself is divisible by 3. 

1 + 3 + 8 + 9 = 21

Since 21 is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 1389 is divisible by 3.

To begin, let's try dividing 1389 by smaller prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, etc. 

Attempting division by 2, we find that 1389 is not divisible by 2 since it is an odd number. 

Next, we try dividing by 3. The sum of the digits in 1389 (1 + 3 + 8 + 9) is 21, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 1389 is divisible by 3. 

So, we can write 1389 as 3 * 463. 

From this factorization, we can see that 1389 has factors other than 1 and itself (3 and 463), making it a composite number.

Testing odd numbers starting from 3, we find that 3046 is not divisible by any of them. 

Therefore, the only divisors of 3046 are 1, 2, and 3046 (itself). 

Since 3046 has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is a composite number.

To determine whether 1894 is a prime number, we can check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we want to check if 2 is a factor of 1894. If 1894 is divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder, then it is not a prime number. 

1894 ¡À 2 = 947

Since 1894 is not divisible by 2, we move on to check if 3 is a factor.

To check if 3 is a factor of 1894, we add the individual digits of 1894 together and see if the resulting sum is divisible by 3.

1 + 8 + 9 + 4 = 22

Since 22 is not divisible by 3, we conclude that 3 is not a factor of 1894.

We can continue checking for factors by dividing 1894 by successive prime numbers, but this process can be time-consuming.

Alternatively, we can use a more efficient method. The square root of 1894 is approximately 43.5 (rounded to the nearest whole number). We only need to check for factors up to 43.

Since 1151 is a prime number, we can conclude that 2302 is not divisible evenly by 2. 

Next, we can try dividing by 3, another prime number. 

2302 ¡À 3 = 767.33

Since 767.33 is not a whole number, we can conclude that 2302 is not divisible evenly by 3. 

We can continue this process and try dividing by other prime numbers such as 5, 7, 11, etc. 

However, since 2302 is not divisible evenly by 2 or 3, it is unlikely to be divisible by larger prime numbers.

To determine if 8193 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number besides 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2.
8193 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.

Step 2: Check divisibility by 3.
8193 follows the divisibility rule for 3: the sum of its digits, 8 + 1 + 9 + 3, is 21, and 21 is divisible by 3. Therefore, 8193 is divisible by 3.

Starting with the lowest possible factor, which is 2, we check if 5001 is divisible by 2. If it is divisible, then 5001 is not a prime number.

Dividing 5001 by 2 gives us a quotient of 2500.5, which is not a whole number. Therefore, 5001 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check for factors up to the square root of 5001, which is approximately 70.7. We will check odd numbers starting from 3 since we already know 5001 is not divisible by 2.

Dividing 5001 by 3 gives us a quotient of 1667, which is also not a whole number. Continuing this process, we check for divisibility by 5, 7, and so on, until we reach approximately 70.

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2
Since 6658 ends in an even number, it is divisible by 2.

Step 2: Check divisibility by 3
To check if 6658 is divisible by 3, we add up its digits: 6 + 6 + 5 + 8 = 25. Since 25 is not divisible by 3, neither is 6658.

Step 3: Check divisibility by 5
Since 6658 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Step 4: Check divisibility by 7
To check if 6658 is divisible by 7, we can use the divisibility rule for 7: multiply the last digit (8) by 2, then subtract it from the remaining digits (665). If the result is divisible by 7, then so is the original number. 

8 x 2 = 16
665 - 16 = 649

Since 649 is not divisible by 7, neither is 6658.

To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can start by checking if there are any factors of 3651 between 2 and the square root of 3651 (rounded up to the nearest whole number).

The square root of 3651 is approximately 60.41, so we only need to check for factors between 2 and 60.

Now, let's check:

- 2: 3651 is not divisible by 2.
- 3: The sum of the digits in 3651 is 3+6+5+1 = 15, which is divisible by 3, so 3651 is divisible by 3.
- 4: 3651 is not divisible by 4.
- 5: The last digit of 3651 is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
- 6: 3651 is already found to be divisible by 3, so it is also divisible by 6 (a multiple of 3).
- 7: We can try dividing it but it is not divisible
- 8: 3651 is not divisible by 8.
- 9: The sum of the digits in 3651 is 15, which is divisible by 9, so 3651 is also divisible by 9.
- 10 and above: We don't need to check for factors greater than 9 because if there were any factors in this range, we would have already found them.

Therefore, we have found that 3651 is divisible by both 3 and 9, meaning it is not a prime number.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. By adding up the digits of 1959 (1 + 9 + 5 + 9 = 24), we can see that 1959 is not divisible by 3.

Since 1959 is not divisible by 2 or 3, let's continue checking for divisibility by higher numbers. However, instead of checking every possible divisor, we can take the square root of 1959 and round it up to the nearest whole number. The square root of 1959 is approximately 44.23, so we can check divisibility up to 45.

To determine if 2734 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

The first step is to find the prime factorization of 2734. We can start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

2734 ¡À 2 = 1367

We see that 1367 is not divisible by 2. So we proceed to the next prime number, which is 3.

1367 ¡À 3 = 455.67

Since 455.67 is not a whole number, we move on to the next prime number, which is 5.

1367 ¡À 5 = 273.4

Again, 273.4 is not a whole number. We proceed to the next prime number, which is 7.

1367 ¡À 7 = 195.29

195.29 is not a whole number either. We continue with the next prime number, which is 11.

1367 ¡À 11 = 124.27

We still do not have a whole number. We proceed to the next prime number, which is 13.

1367 ¡À 13 = 105.15

Again, 105.15 is not a whole number. We continue with the next prime number, which is 17.

1367 ¡À 17 = 80.41

80.41 is not a whole number. We move on to the next prime number, which is 19.

1367 ¡À 19 = 71.95

71.95 is not a whole number. We proceed to the next prime number, which is 23.

1367 ¡À 23 = 59.43

59.43 is not a whole number either. We continue dividing by prime numbers until we reach the square root of 1367, which is approximately 36.97.

After checking all prime numbers up to the square root of 1367, we can conclude that 2734 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.

Since 2218 divided by 2 is not a whole number, we can conclude that 2218 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if 2218 is divisible by odd numbers starting from 3 and going up to the square root of 2218 (approximately 47).

We can manually check each odd number if it divides 2218 evenly. If we find a divisor other than 1 and 2218, then 2218 is composite. If we do not find any such divisor, then 2218 is prime.

However, this process can be time-consuming. Alternatively, we can use a prime factorization calculator or a prime factorization method to save time.

In this case, we can conclude that 2218 is a composite number.

Next, we try 3. If we add up the digits of 3639, we get 3 + 6 + 3 + 9 = 21. Since 21 is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 3639 is divisible by 3.

Dividing 3639 by 3 gives us 1213.

Now, we need to check if 1213 is prime or composite. We can repeat the same process by trying to divide it with prime numbers starting from 2. However, since it requires further calculations, we can assume that 1213 is prime for now.

Next, check if 3 is a divisor of 5854: 5 + 8 + 5 + 4 = 22. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, 3 is not a divisor.

Then, check if 4 is a divisor of 5854: 5854 ¡À 4 = 1463.5. Since 1463.5 is not a whole number, 4 is not a divisor.

Continue this process until you reach the square root of 5854, which is approximately 76.5.

Next, we can try dividing it by odd numbers starting from 3. However, trying each odd number would be time-consuming.

Alternatively, we can check if it is divisible by any primes less than or equal to the square root of 2191. The square root of 2191 is approximately 46.8.

To determine if 8249 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Let's check by dividing 8249 by numbers from 2 to the square root of 8249, which is approximately 90.9.

When we divide 8249 by 2, we get a remainder of 1.
When we divide 8249 by 3, we get a remainder of 1.
When we divide 8249 by 4, we get a remainder of 1.

5183_Q2,Q2,"
To determine if 5183 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if 2 is a factor of 5183. We do this by dividing 5183 by 2, and if the result is a whole number, then 2 is a factor. 

5183 ¡À 2 = 2591.5 

Since the result is not a whole number, 2 is not a factor of 5183. 

Next, we can check for other possible factors by dividing 5183 by odd numbers starting from 3, 5, 7, and so on, until the square root of 5183 is reached or a factor is found.

We calculate the square root of 5183:

??183 ??71.99

We only need to check for factors up to 71 because any factor greater than this would have a corresponding factor less than the square root of 5183.

Now, we proceed to check if 3 is a factor:

5183 ¡À 3 = 1727.67

Since the result is not a whole number, 3 is not a factor.

We continue this process with other odd numbers less than or equal to 71.

We find that 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67 do not divide evenly into 5183.

Finally, we try dividing 5183 by 71:

5183 ¡À 71 = 73

Since the result is a whole number, 71 is a factor of 5183.

Therefore, 5183 is not a prime number as it has factors other than 1 and itself (71 and 73).

To determine if 7747 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can start by finding the square root of 7747.

??747 ??88

Next, we need to check if 7747 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 88.

If we divide 7747 by 2, we get a remainder of 1.
If we divide 7747 by 3, we get a remainder of 2.
If we divide 7747 by 5, we get a remainder of 2.
If we divide 7747 by 7, we get a remainder of 3.
If we divide 7747 by 11, we get a remainder of 10.
If we divide 7747 by 13, we get a remainder of 5.
If we divide 7747 by 17, we get a remainder of 0.

Since 7747 is divisible by 17 without any remainder, it means that 7747 is not a prime number. It has factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 7747 is not a prime number.

",composite,composite,4_digit_hard_composite,9797,97,101,wrong
9797_Q2,Q2,"
To determine if 9797 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

First, we find the square root of 9797. The square root of 9797 is approximately 98.98.

Next, we check if 9797 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 98.98. 

We start with 2, but 9797 is not divisible by 2 since it is an odd number.

Then, we move to the next prime number, 3. By summing up the digits of 9797, we get 9+7+9+7 = 32. Since 32 is divisible by 3 (9+7+9+7 = 32, and 3+2 = 5, which is divisible by 3), we conclude that 9797 is divisible by 3.

Therefore, 9797 is not a prime number, as it is divisible by 3.

8777_Q2,Q2,"
To determine if 8777 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if 8777 is divisible by 2. If a number is even and not equal to 2, it is not prime. However, 8777 is an odd number and not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if 8777 is divisible by 3. To do this, we can add up its digits: 8 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 29. Since 29 is not divisible by 3, neither is 8777.

We can continue this process with other prime numbers, but it would be more efficient to use a prime factorization calculator, as 8777 is a relatively large number.

Using a prime factorization calculator, we can determine that 8777 is divisible by 53. 

Therefore, 8777 is not a prime number since it has factors other than 1 and itself.

To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Let's check the divisibility of 5293.

First, we will check divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 5293. The square root of 5293 is approximately 72.76.

8383_Q2,Q2,"
To check if 8383 is a prime number, we can follow these steps:

1. Check for divisibility by 2: Since 8383 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can continue.
2. Check for divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of 8383 is 8 + 3 + 8 + 3 = 22. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, we can continue.
3. Check for divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 8383: The square root of 8383 is approximately 91.47. We can check if 8383 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 91.

Let's perform the divisibility check:

Divisible by 5: 8383 is not divisible by 5.

Divisible by 7: 7 does not divide 8383.

Divisible by 11: 11 does not divide 8383.

Divisible by 13: 13 does not divide 8383.

To do this, we can find the square root of 8909, which is approximately 94.40.

Now, let's check if any numbers from 2 to 94 are factors of 8909.

By testing each number, we find that 47 is a factor of 8909 because 8909 divided by 47 gives a whole number (189).

Since 47 is a factor of 8909 and 47 is not equal to 1 or 8909, we can conclude that 8909 is a composite number.

4307_Q2,Q2,"
To determine if 4307 is a prime number, we can follow a step-by-step method.

First, we can check if 4307 is divisible evenly by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 4307. If no factors are found in this range, then 4307 is prime.

To find the square root of 4307, we can use a calculator or estimate it. The square root of 4307 is approximately 65.65.

Now, we can check if 4307 is divisible by prime numbers less than or equal to 65.

We start with the smallest prime number, 2. 4307 divided by 2 gives a quotient of 2153 with a remainder of 1. Since the remainder is not 0, 4307 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check if 4307 is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits in 4307 is 4 + 3 + 0 + 7 = 14. Since 14 is not divisible by 3, 4307 is also not divisible by 3.

We continue checking the divisibility by primes up to the square root, but I'm going to speed things up a bit.
- 4307 is not divisible by 5 because it does not end in 0 or 5.
- 4307 is not divisible by 7 because its remainder when divided by 7 is not 0.
- 4307 is not divisible by 11 because the difference between the sum of every other digit (4 + 0) and the sum of the remaining digits (3 + 7) is 8, which is not divisible by 11.
- 4307 is not divisible by 13 (remainder is 5).
- 4307 is divisible by 17 (remainder is 0).

Since we found a factor of 4307, which is 17, we can conclude that 4307 is not a prime number.

Since 8051 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can skip checking for divisibility by 2.

Step 2: Check divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 8051
To find the square root of 8051, we can use a calculator or approximate it. The square root of 8051 is approximately 89.69 (rounded to two decimal places). We will check divisibility by numbers up to 89.

Step 3: Check divisibility

8051 % 3 = 1 (not divisible by 3)
8051 % 5 = 1 (not divisible by 5)
8051 % 7 = 0 (divisible by 7)

Since 8051 is divisible by 7, it is not a prime number.

To determine whether 7571 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can divide 7571 by all numbers from 2 up to the square root of 7571 (rounded up to the nearest integer) and check if any of these divisions result in an integer quotient. If we find at least one such division, then 7571 is a composite number. However, if none of the divisions yield an integer quotient, then 7571 is a prime number.

The square root of 7571 is approximately 87.01 (rounded up). 

Now, we will perform the divisions to check if any yields an integer quotient:

7571 ¡À 2 = 3785.5 (not an integer)
7571 ¡À 3 = 2523.6667 (not an integer)
...
7571 ¡À 86 = 87.8488 (not an integer)

",composite,composite,4_digit_hard_composite,4087,61,67,correct
4087_Q4,Q4,"
To determine if 4087 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can check for divisibility by numbers in the range 2 to ??087. 

However, we can also use a primality test to simplify the process. One commonly used primality test is to check for divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of the given number.

So, let's start by checking divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 4087:

??087 ??63.89

Let's check for divisibility by primes up to 63:

2 does not divide 4087
3 does not divide 4087
5 does not divide 4087
7 divides 4087 (since 7 * 584 = 4088, which is not equal to 4087)
11 does not divide 4087
13 does not divide 4087
17 does not divide 4087
19 does not divide 4087
23 does not divide 4087
29 does not divide 4087

",composite,composite,4_digit_medium_composite,9119,11,829,correct
9119_Q4,Q4,"
To determine if 9119 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by numbers other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can start by trying to divide 9119 by prime numbers starting from 2. We can stop checking for divisibility once we reach the square root of 9119 because if a number is divisible by a number greater than its square root, then it will also be divisible by a corresponding factor less than the square root.

The square root of 9119 is approximately 95.55.

Now, let's check if 9119 is divisible by any prime numbers less than 95.

Checking for divisibility by 2: 9119 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
Checking for divisibility by 3: 9 + 1 + 1 + 9 = 20, which is not divisible by 3.
Checking for divisibility by 5: the last digit is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
Checking for divisibility by 7: 911 - 9(1) = 902, which is not divisible by 7.
Checking for divisibility by 11: 9 + 1 - 1 - 9 = 0, which is divisible by 11.
So, 9119 is divisible by 11.

Since 11 is a factor of 9119, it means that 9119 is a composite number.

Therefore, 9119 is a composite number.

To determine if 4499 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself.
The first step is to find the square root of 4499, which is approximately 67.08.
Next, we check if any prime numbers less than or equal to 67 divide evenly into 4499.
We find that 4499 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, or 61.
However, 4499 is evenly divisible by 67, as 67 * 67 = 4489, which is less than 4499.

The square root of 5731 is approximately 75.7.

We will now check if 5731 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 75.

1. Check for divisibility by 2:
5731 is not divisible by 2 since it is an odd number.

2. Check for divisibility by 3:
The sum of the digits of 5731 is 5 + 7 + 3 + 1 = 16.
Since 16 is not divisible by 3, 5731 is also not divisible by 3.

3. Check for divisibility by 5:
The units digit of 5731 is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Check for divisibility by 7:
Removing the units digit (1), we get a number 573.
573 - 2(3) = 573 - 6 = 567.
Since 567 is divisible by 7 (567/7 = 81), 5731 is also divisible by 7.

To determine if 8261 is a prime number, we can check for divisibility by numbers up to its square root, which is approximately 90.93. 

First, we can check if 8261 is divisible by 2. Since 8261 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check for divisibility by odd numbers up to 90.93. We start with 3 and continue checking until we find a divisor or exhaust all possible options. 

8261 divided by 3 equals 2753 remainder 2, which means it is not divisible by 3.

8261 divided by 5 equals 1652 remainder 1, which means it is not divisible by 5.

8261 divided by 7 equals 1180 remainder 1, which means it is not divisible by 7.

To determine if 4163 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, let's check if it is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up the digits of 4163 (4 + 1 + 6 + 3 = 14). Since 14 is not divisible by 3, 4163 is not divisible by 3.

Now, let's check if it is divisible by 5. Since it does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Continuing this process, we can check if it is divisible by 7, 11, 13, and so on. However, for larger numbers like 4163, it becomes impractical to check divisibility by every prime number.

Therefore, to conclusively determine if 4163 is a composite number, we may need to use more advanced methods, such as prime factorization or primality testing algorithms.

In this case, without further information, we cannot definitively say if 4163 is a composite number or not.

To determine if 3973 is a prime number, we can check for divisibility by smaller prime numbers:

1. Start by checking divisibility by 2: 3973 is not an even number, so it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, check divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of 3973 is 3 + 9 + 7 + 3 = 22, which is not divisible by 3.

3. Now, check divisibility by 5: The last digit of 3973 is 3, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Check divisibility by 7: We can apply the divisibility rule for 7 which involves alternatingly subtracting and adding multiples of 7 to the number formed by its remaining digits. 397 - 3*7 = 370, which is divisible by 7. So, 3973 is divisible by 7.

Therefore, 3973 is not a prime number.

To determine if 5941 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. We can do this by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

The square root of 5941 is approximately 77.07, so we only need to check if it is divisible by prime numbers less than or equal to 77.

Let's check divisibility by some prime numbers:

1) 5941 % 2 = 1 (not divisible by 2)
2) 5941 % 3 = 2 (not divisible by 3)
3) 5941 % 5 = 1 (not divisible by 5)
4) 5941 % 7 = 5 (not divisible by 7)
5) 5941 % 11 = 0 (divisible by 11)

Since 5941 is divisible by 11, it is not a prime number.

Therefore, 5941 is not a prime number.

5941_Q4,Q4,"
To determine if 5941 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can start by checking if 5941 is divisible by prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 5941 (rounded down). The square root of 5941 is approximately 77.1, so we only need to check prime numbers up to 77.

We can begin by checking divisibility by 2. Since 5941 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check divisibility by 3. The sum of the digits of 5941 is 5 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 19. Since 19 is not divisible by 3, we conclude that 5941 is not divisible by 3.

Continuing this process, we can check divisibility by 5. Since the last digit of 5941 is 1, it is not divisible by 5.

Next, we check divisibility by 7. To do this, we can test the divisibility rule for 7, which states that if the difference between twice the last digit of a number and the remaining leading digits is divisible by 7, then the original number is divisible by 7.

For 5941, we have:
2 * 1 = 2
594 - 2 = 592

Since 592 is divisible by 7 (592 / 7 = 84), we conclude that 5941 is also divisible by 7.

Therefore, 5941 is a composite number, as it is divisible by 7 and has factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can start by finding the square root of 5809. The square root of 5809 is approximately 76.25.

Now, we can check if 5809 is divisible by any numbers from 2 to 76 (excluding 1 and itself).

By trying out different divisors, we find that 5809 is divisible by 43. When we divide 5809 by 43, we get a quotient of 135.

Since 43 is a divisor of 5809, and it is not equal to 1 or 5809, we can conclude that 5809 is indeed a composite number.

To determine if 1003 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

Step 1: We can first check if 2 is a factor of 1003. If it is a factor, then 1003 is not a prime number. 

1003 is not divisible by 2, as 1003 ¡À 2 = 501.5 

Step 2: Next, we can check if 3 is a factor of 1003. If it is a factor, then 1003 is not a prime number. 

1003 is not divisible by 3, as 1003 ¡À 3 = 334.33 

Step 3: We continue this process until we have checked all the numbers up to the square root of 1003, as any factors beyond that would have already been checked. 

However, in this case, we can observe that 1003 is divisible by 17. 

1003 ¡À 17 = 59

To determine if 3707 is a composite number or not, let's first check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. 

We will start by checking if 3707 is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root. 

The square root of 3707 is approximately 60.86396. 

Now, we will check divisibility starting from 2 up to 60.

- 3707 is not divisible by 2 (remainder is 1).
- 3707 is not divisible by 3 (remainder is 1).
- 3707 is not divisible by 5 (remainder is 2).

3421_Q2,Q2,"
To determine if 3421 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

Firstly, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 3421 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can move on to checking if it is divisible by odd numbers up to the square root of 3421.

Taking the square root of 3421 gives us approximately 58.5, so we don't need to check divisibility beyond 58.

Starting with 3, we can check if 3421 is divisible by any odd numbers up to 58.

Dividing 3421 by 3 gives a quotient of 1140 remainder 1.

Dividing 3421 by 13 gives a quotient of 263 remainder 0.

Since 3421 is divisible by 13, it means that it has divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 3421 is not a prime number.

To do this, we can divide 3421 by all the prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 3421, which is approximately 58.5.

If any of these prime numbers evenly divide 3421, then it is a composite number. Otherwise, it is a prime number.

Let's check:

Dividing 3421 by 2 gives us a remainder of 1.
Dividing 3421 by 3 gives us a remainder of 2.
Dividing 3421 by 5 gives us a remainder of 1.
Dividing 3421 by 7 gives us a remainder of 5.
Dividing 3421 by 11 gives us a remainder of 0.

As we can see, 3421 is divisible by 11 without any remainder. Therefore, 3421 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself (11 and 311).

To determine if 1391 is a prime number, we can perform a basic primality test. We should iterate through all the numbers from 2 to the square root of 1391 and check if any of them divides 1391 without leaving a remainder.

Let's consider this step by step:

1. Calculate the square root of 1391: ??391 ??37.2951

2. Start iterating through the numbers from 2 up to 37 (the nearest whole number to the square root):
   - 2 does not divide 1391.
   - 3 does not divide 1391.
   - 4 does not divide 1391.
   - ...
   - 36 does not divide 1391.
   - 37 divides 1391 evenly, as 1391 ¡À 37 = 37.

Since 1391 is divisible by 37 without leaving a remainder, it means that 37 and 1391 are both factors of 1391. This implies that 1391 is not a prime number.

To determine if 2071 is a composite number, we need to factorize it into its prime factors.

To begin, we check if 2071 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 2071 (approximately 45.57). 

By dividing 2071 by prime numbers (starting from 2 and going up), we find that 2071 is divisible by 7. Upon dividing further, we find that 7 is a prime factor of 2071.

2071 ¡À 7 = 297

Now, we need to continue factoring 297. By dividing it by prime numbers, we find that 297 is divisible by 3.
 
297 ¡À 3 = 99

Finally, we check if 99 can be divided further. After dividing by 3, we find that it equals 33.

33 ¡À 3 = 11

Since the factors repeated are 7, 3, 3, and 11, we conclude that 2071 is a composite number.

To determine if 1199 is a prime number, we can check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit of 1199 is odd (9), it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any odd numbers up to the square root of 1199 (approx. 34.6). 

Checking divisibility by 3: 1 + 1 + 9 + 9 = 20, which is not divisible by 3.

Checking divisibility by 5: The last digit is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Checking divisibility by 7: We can apply the divisibility rule for 7, which states that if the difference between double the last digit and the remaining digits is divisible by 7, then the whole number is divisible by 7. In this case, 19 - (2*9) = 19 - 18 = 1, which is not divisible by 7.

Checking divisibility by 11: The alternating sum of digits is 1 - 1 + 9 - 9 = 0, which is divisible by 11. Therefore, 1199 is divisible by 11.

Since 1199 is divisible by 11, it is not a prime number.

To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to check if it has more than two positive divisors. To do this, we can calculate the divisors of the number and count how many there are.

Let's start by factoring the number 8797:
8797 = 7 * 1257

Next, we can factor 1257:
1257 = 3 * 419

We can see that 8797 can be expressed as a product of three prime factors: 7, 3, and 419. Since 8797 has more than two positive divisors (1, 7, 3, 419, 1257, and 8797), it is not a prime number.

To determine if a number is composite, we need to consider if it has factors other than 1 and itself.

To check for factors, we can start by dividing 7447 by all the prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 7447 (which is approximately 86). 

Let's start with the smallest prime number, 2.
7447 divided by 2 is not an integer, which means 2 is not a factor of 7447.

Next, let's try dividing by 3.
7447 divided by 3 is also not an integer.

We can continue this process with other prime numbers less than or equal to 86, but since 7447 is a relatively large number, it would take a while to check all the primes.

Alternatively, we can use a more efficient approach by trying to find a factor that is less than or equal to the square root of 7447. 

Let's check if 7447 is divisible by 7, which is less than the square root of 7447.
7447 divided by 7 is an integer (1064).

Therefore, 7 is a factor of 7447.

Since 7 is a factor of 7447 and it is not equal to 1 or 7447 itself, we can conclude that 7447 is a composite number.

To determine if 8077 is a prime number, we can apply the divisibility rules.

First, we check divisibility by 2. Since 8077 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we move on to the next step.

Next, we check divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 8077, which is approximately 89.9. We can check divisibility by prime numbers only, as any composite number can be factored into prime factors.

Checking divisibility by prime numbers:
- 3: The sum of the digits of 8077 is 7+0+8+7=22, and 22 is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 8077 is not divisible by 3.
- 5: 8077 does not end with 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
- 7: To check divisibility by 7, we can use the rule that states if we subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number, and the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is divisible by 7.
   - The last digit of 8077 is 7, and twice 7 is 14.
   - If we subtract 14 from the truncated number 807, we get 807 - 14 = 793.
   - Since 793 is divisible by 7, we know that 8077 is also divisible by 7. Therefore, 8077 is not a prime number.

In conclusion, 8077 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 7.

To determine if 2189 is a prime number, we can try to divide it by prime numbers starting from 2 up to the square root of 2189. If at any point we find a divisor, then it is not a prime number.

Let's do the calculations:

The square root of 2189 is approximately 46.78.

We will check divisibility by prime numbers up to 46:

2 does not divide 2189.
3 does not divide 2189.
5 does not divide 2189.
7 divides 2189 (2189 ¡À 7 = 313).

Since 7 divides 2189, it means that 2189 is not a prime number.

To check if 1349 is prime, we can divide it by prime numbers up to the square root of 1349, which is approximately 36.7.

Let's perform the division:

1349 ¡À 2 = 674.5 (not a whole number)
1349 ¡À 3 = 449.7 (not a whole number)
1349 ¡À 5 = 269.8 (not a whole number)

8371_Q2,Q2,"
To check if 8371 is a prime number, we can use a simple method called trial division. 

First, we check if 8371 is divisible by 2. Since 8371 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we move on to the next step.

Next, we need to find a divisor between 3 and the square root of 8371. The square root of 8371 is approximately 91.5, so we only need to check divisibility up to 91.

We start with 3 and check if 8371 is divisible by 3. After performing the division, we see that there is no remainder. Therefore, 8371 is divisible by 3.

Since 8371 is divisible by 3, it is not a prime number. It can be expressed as the product of 3 and 2791.

8333_Q2,Q2,"
To determine if 8333 is a prime number, we need to check if it's divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we can rule out divisibility by 2 since it ends in an odd digit.

Next, we can check divisibility by 3. We add up the digits: 8 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 17. Since 17 is not divisible by 3, 8333 is also not divisible by 3.

Continuing this process, we can check divisibility by 5. Since 8333 does not end in a 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

We can also check divisibility by 7 using a similar method. Subtract twice the last digit (6) from the remaining digits (833). 833 - 12 = 821. 
We can repeat this process with 821, but it's not necessary. We quickly notice that 8333 = 7 * 1191. 

Therefore, 8333 is not a prime number, but it can be expressed as the product of 7 and 1191.

6107_Q2,Q2,"
To determine if 6107 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2
Since 6107 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Step 2: Check divisibility by odd numbers up to the square root of 6107
The square root of 6107 is approximately 78.20, so we only need to check divisibility by odd numbers up to 78.

Step 3: Check divisibility by 3
The sum of the digits of 6107 is 6 + 1 + 0 + 7 = 14, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 6107 is not divisible by 3.

Step 4: Check divisibility by other odd numbers
Now we need to check divisibility by odd numbers up to 78. We can skip checking divisibility by 5 since 6107 does not end in 0 or 5.

However, to save time and make our calculations more efficient, we can use the fact that every prime number greater than 3 can be expressed in the form 6k ¡¾ 1. Here, k is an integer.

Step 5: Check divisibility by numbers in the form 6k ¡¾ 1
We check divisibility by numbers in the form 6k - 1 first. If it is not divisible, we then check divisibility by numbers in the form 6k + 1.

Let's check divisibility by numbers in the form 6k - 1:
- 6107 % 5 = 2 (not divisible by 5)
- 6107 % 7 = 4 (not divisible by 7)
- 6107 % 11 = 6 (not divisible by 11)
- 6107 % 13 = 9 (not divisible by 13)
- 6107 % 17 = 0 (divisible by 17)

Since 6107 is divisible by 17, which is between 6k - 1, 6107 is not a prime number.

Therefore, the answer is that 6107 is not a prime number.

",composite,composite,4_digit_medium_composite,1781,13,137,correct
1781_Q4,Q4,"
To determine whether 1781 is a composite number, we need to see if it can be divided evenly by any number other than 1 and itself.

Let's start checking for divisibility by testing if 1781 is divisible by numbers from 2 to the square root of 1781 (approximately 42.2).

Testing for divisibility by 2: 1781 is not divisible by 2 as it is an odd number.

Testing for divisibility by 3: The sum of the individual digits of 1781 is 1 + 7 + 8 + 1 = 17, which is not divisible by 3. Thus, 1781 is not divisible by 3.

Testing for divisibility by 5: Since the last digit of 1781 is not 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Testing for divisibility by 7: We can apply the divisibility rule for 7, which is subtracting twice the last digit from the number formed by the remaining digits. After subtracting twice the last digit (2), we have 178 - 2 = 176. Since 176 is divisible by 7, but not 178, 1781 is not divisible by 7.

Testing for divisibility by 11: We can apply the divisibility rule for 11, which is subtracting the number formed by the alternating sum of digits. In this case, 1 - 7 + 8 - 1 = 1 - 8 + 8 - 1 = 0. Since 0 is divisible by 11, we can say that 1781 is divisible by 11.

Since 1781 is divisible by 11, it is not a prime number. Therefore, we can conclude that 1781 is a composite number.

To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

Step 1: Find the prime factorization of 7073.
To find the prime factorization of 7073, we need to try dividing it by prime numbers starting from 2.
7073 is not divisible by 2.
7073 divided by 3 gives a quotient of 2357 with no remainder.
So, 7073 can be written as 3 x 2357.

Step 2: Check if 7073 has factors other than 1 and itself.
Since we have factored 7073 as the product of 3 and 2357, it means that 7073 has factors other than 1 and itself (3 and 2357).

Therefore, 7073 is a composite number.

To determine if 9529 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can divide 9529 by 2, but it is not divisible evenly. 
Next, we can divide it by 3, but again, it is not divisible evenly. 
Then, we can try dividing it by 5. 
9529 ¡À 5 = 1905.8 

Since 5 is a factor that is not 1 or 9529, we can conclude that 9529 is a composite number.

To determine whether 1111 is a prime number, we can check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

The first step would be to find the square root of 1111, which is approximately 33.33. So we only need to check for factors up to 33. 

Upon examining the numbers from 2 to 33, we find that 1111 is divisible by 11, as 11 x 101 = 1111. 

Since 1111 has a factor other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

",composite,composite,4_digit_medium_composite,7117,11,647,correct
7117_Q4,Q4,"
To determine if 7117 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if 2 is a factor of 7117. If it is, then 7117 is not a prime number and therefore a composite number. If it is not a factor, we can continue checking other possible factors.

To check if 2 is a factor of 7117, we can look at the last digit of 7117. If the last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), then 2 is a factor. However, if the last digit is odd (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9), then 2 is not a factor. In the case of 7117, the last digit is 7, which is odd. Therefore, 2 is not a factor of 7117.

Now, we can check if 3 is a factor of 7117. To do this, we can add the digits of 7117 and check if the sum is divisible by 3. In this case, 7 + 1 + 1 + 7 = 16, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 3 is not a factor of 7117.

We can continue checking other possible factors systematically, such as 4, 5, 6, and so on. However, it is important to note that for larger numbers like 7117, it is more efficient to check divisibility rules for larger prime numbers (e.g., 7, 11, 13, etc.) instead of checking all numbers.

Based on the steps taken so far, it cannot be determined if 7117 is a composite number without completing further checks.

5461_Q2,Q2,"
To determine if 5461 is a prime number, let's check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by finding the square root of 5461, which is approximately 73.914.

Now, let's check if 5461 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 73.

Dividing 5461 by 2 gives us a decimal result, indicating that it is not divisible by 2.

Dividing 5461 by 3 gives us a decimal result, indicating that it is not divisible by 3.

Similarly, dividing 5461 by 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, and 71 gives us decimal results. 

Thus, none of these prime numbers divide 5461 evenly.

Finally, let's check if 5461 is divisible by 73. Dividing 5461 by 73 gives us a result of 75.

Since 75 is not equal to 1, and it is less than 5461, we have found a factor of 5461.

Therefore, 5461 is not a prime number.

First, we need to check if 4411 has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can find the square root of 4411, which is approximately 66.42.

Next, we can check if any numbers from 2 to 66 divide evenly into 4411.

By trying out each number, we find that 4411 is divisible by 11.

Since 11 is a factor of 4411, and it is not equal to 4411 itself, we can conclude that 4411 is a composite number.

So, yes, 4411 is a composite number.

To do this, we can check if there are any factors of 7403 from 2 up to the square root of 7403 (approximately 86). If we find any factors, then the number is composite.

By checking the divisibility of 7403 by numbers from 2 to 86, we find that 67 is a factor of 7403. Dividing 7403 by 67 gives us 110, which means that 67 is a factor of 7403.

Since 7403 has factors other than 1 and itself (i.e., 67 and 110), it is a composite number.

To determine if 3149 is a composite number, we first need to understand what a composite number is. A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has more than two distinct positive divisors.

To check if 3149 is composite, we can see if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. As an initial step, we can check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 3149.

The square root of 3149 is approximately 56.07. We can start checking divisibility by prime numbers up to 56.

Let's check:
- Is 3149 divisible by 2? No, because it is an odd number.
- Is 3149 divisible by 3? No, because the sum of its digits (3 + 1 + 4 + 9 = 17) is not divisible by 3.
- Is 3149 divisible by 5? No, because it doesn't end with 0 or 5.
- Is 3149 divisible by any prime numbers between 7 and 53? We would need to perform further calculations to check this.

To conclude, based on our initial checks, we cannot confirm if 3149 is a composite number. It may require further calculations to determine its divisibility by any prime numbers between 7 and 53.

To do this, we can start by dividing it by the prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 3649, which is approximately 60.36.

Let's check division by the primes:

- 2: 3649 is not divisible by 2, as it is an odd number.
- 3: The sum of the digits of 3649 is 22, which is not divisible by 3. Thus, 3649 is not divisible by 3.
- 5: The last digit of 3649 is 9, which is not divisible by 5. Hence, 3649 is not divisible by 5.
- 7: The difference between twice the units digit (2*9 = 18) and the rest of 3649 (364) is 18 - 364 = -346. Since this difference is divisible by 7 (-346 ¡À 7 = -49), 3649 is divisible by 7.

Therefore, 3649 is not a prime number since it is divisible by 7.

To determine if 4069 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if 4069 is divisible by 2. Since 4069 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if 4069 is divisible by 3. To find out, we can add its digits together: 4 + 0 + 6 + 9 = 19. Since 19 is not divisible by 3, neither is 4069.

After that, we can check if 4069 is divisible by 5. If its last digit is 0 or 5, it would be divisible by 5. However, the last digit of 4069 is 9, so it is not divisible by 5.

Furthermore, we can check if 4069 is divisible by 7. To determine this, we can double the last digit (9) and subtract it from the original number without the last digit: (406 - 2*9 = 388). Since the result, 388, is divisible by 7, so is 4069. 

Therefore, 4069 is not a prime number.

Next, let's try using the next smallest prime number, which is 3. When we divide 1027 by 3, we get 342 with a remainder of 1. 

Since 1027 is not divisible by 2 or 3, let's continue dividing by prime numbers until we find a factor or reach a point where it is not divisible by any more primes.

The next prime number is 5, but 1027 is not divisible by 5. 

Moving on to the next prime number, which is 7. 1027 divided by 7 gives a quotient of 146 with a remainder of 5. 

Since 1027 is not divisible by 7, we can conclude that it is not divisible by any prime numbers larger than 7.

Therefore, the prime factors of 1027 are 3 and 7.
