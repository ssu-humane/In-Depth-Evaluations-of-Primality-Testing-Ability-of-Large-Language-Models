To determine if 519 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

The first step is to check if it is divisible by 2. Since 519 is an odd number, we can skip checking for divisibility by 2.

Next, we check divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 519, which is approximately 22.8. We can round this up to 23.

Now we will check divisibility by prime numbers up to 23:

- 519 ÷ 3 = 173, remainder 0
- 519 ÷ 5 = 103.8, remainder 4
- 519 ÷ 7 = 74.1, remainder 1

To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has more than two distinct factors. 

To find the factors of 519, we can start by dividing it by 2, which gives us 259. 

Next, 259 is not divisible by 2, so we move on to the next prime number, which is 3. Dividing 259 by 3, we get 86.33, which is not a whole number. 

We continue dividing by larger prime numbers such as 5, 7, 11, and so on. However, we find that none of them divide evenly into 259. 

Since we have exhausted all the prime numbers up to the square root of 259 (which is approximately 16), and none of them divide evenly into 259, we can conclude that 259 is a prime number.

923 is not divisible by 2, as it is an odd number.

Dividing 923 by 3, we get: 923 ÷ 3 = 307.67

Since the result is not a whole number, we move on to the next prime number.

Dividing 923 by 5, we get: 923 ÷ 5 = 184.6

Again, the result is not a whole number, so we continue.

Dividing 923 by 7, we get: 923 ÷ 7 = 131.86

Once more, the result is not a whole number.

Dividing 923 by 11, we get: 923 ÷ 11 = 83.909

The quotient is still not a whole number.

Dividing 923 by 13, we get: 923 ÷ 13 = 71

Finally, we have obtained a whole number as the quotient.

Therefore, the prime factorization of 923 is 13 × 71.

Since 923 has factors other than 1 and itself (namely, 13 and 71), it is a composite number.

To determine if 5818 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If a number is even and not equal to 2, it is not prime because it has 2 as a factor. 5818 is even, so it is divisible by 2.

5818 divided by 2 is 2909. Since 2909 is an odd number, we can check for divisibility by odd numbers starting from 3. 

Next, we can check for divisibility by 3. 5+8+1+8=22, and 22 is not divisible by 3, so 5818 is also not divisible by 3.

Since 5818 is not divisible by 2 or 3, we can continue checking for divisibility by odd numbers up to ??818, which is approximately 76.

Checking for divisibility by 5, we see that the last digit of 5818 is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Checking divisibility by 7, we can use the divisibility rule which states that we can subtract twice the units digit from the rest of the number. The result, 581 - (2*8) = 581 - 16 = 565, is not divisible by 7, so 5818 is not divisible by 7.

"Is 4835 a prime number? 
Let's think step by step.","
To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

Let's start by checking if 4835 is divisible by 2. If a number is even, it is always divisible by 2. In this case, since 4835 ends with an odd digit (5), it is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check divisibility by 3. To do this, we add up the individual digits of 4835 and see if the sum is divisible by 3. In this case, 4 + 8 + 3 + 5 = 20, and 20 is not divisible by 3.

Now, let's check divisibility by 5. If a number ends with 0 or 5, it is divisible by 5. Since 4835 does not end with 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Lastly, let's check divisibility by 7. This can be a bit more time-consuming, but we can use a trick known as the ""divisibility rule of 7"". We remove the last digit (5) and double it (5 * 2 = 10). Then, we subtract this doubled digit from the remaining digits (483 - 10 = 473). If the resulting number (473) is divisible by 7, then the original number (4835) is also divisible by 7. Otherwise, it is not. 

Let's apply this rule to the remaining digits of 483 (not 4835) to determine if 4835 is divisible by 7: 
47 - 2 * 3 = 47 - 6 = 41.

Since 41 is not divisible by 7, 4835 is not divisible by 7.

From the above checks, we conclude that 4835 is NOT divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 4835 is a prime number.

Step 2: Check divisibility by odd numbers up to the square root of 3891. 
The square root of 3891 is approximately 62.39. We need to check divisibility by odd numbers up to 62.

"Is 9634 a prime number? 
Let's think step by step.","
To determine if 9634 is a prime number, we can use the method of trial division.

First, we check if 9634 is divisible by 2. If it is divisible by 2, then it is not a prime number. However, 9634 is an even number, so we can divide it by 2:

9634 ÷ 2 = 4817

Since 9634 divided by 2 equals 4817, which is not a whole number, we continue checking for divisibility by dividing it by all the prime numbers less than the square root of 9634.

Next, we check if 9634 is divisible by 3. Adding up the digits of 9634, we get:

9 + 6 + 3 + 4 = 22

Since 22 is not divisible by 3, 9634 is not divisible by 3. We continue with other prime numbers:

- 5: 9634 is not divisible by 5.
- 7: 9634 ÷ 7 = 1376
- 11: 9634 ÷ 11 = 876.7272727...

Therefore, 9634 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, or 11. We continue checking for divisibility by prime numbers up until the square root of 9634.

Prime numbers less than the square root of 9634:
- ??634 ??98.15

We find that 9634 is prime if it is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 98. However, we have already checked all primes up until 11, so we can conclude that 9634 is a prime number.

To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can start by checking if 9634 is divisible by prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 9634.

The square root of 9634 is approximately 98.15, so we only need to check divisibility by prime numbers up to 98.

Starting with the lowest prime number, which is 2, we can see that 9634 is not divisible by 2 as it is an odd number.

Next, we check divisibility by 3. The sum of its digits, 9 + 6 + 3 + 4, is equal to 22, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 9634 is not divisible by 3.

We continue checking divisibility by prime numbers up to 98, but since 9634 is not divisible by 2 or 3, it is highly unlikely to be divisible by any other prime numbers less than 98.

Therefore, we can conclude that 9634 is a composite number, as it is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 9634.

To determine if 8185 is a prime number, we need to test its divisibility by prime numbers less than its square root (approximately 90).

First, we check if 8185 is divisible by 2. If the number ends with an even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), it is divisible by 2. However, 8185 ends with an odd digit (5), so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check for divisibility by 3. To do this, we sum the individual digits of 8185: 8 + 1 + 8 + 5 = 22. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, neither is 8185.

Now, we test divisibility by 5. If the number ends with 0 or 5, it is divisible by 5. However, 8185 does not end with 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

To continue verifying if 8185 is prime, we can check divisibility by prime numbers greater than 5, such as 7, 11, 13, and so on. However, these divisibility tests can become cumbersome and time-consuming, especially for larger numbers like 8185.

Alternatively, we can use a calculator or computer program to quickly determine whether 8185 is a prime number. In this case, 8185 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 5 and 23.

To determine if 7171 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we check divisibility by 2. Since 7171 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check divisibility by 3. To do this, we sum up the digits of 7171: 7 + 1 + 7 + 1 = 16. Since 16 is not divisible by 3, 7171 is also not divisible by 3.

We can continue this process for other prime numbers, but instead, we can check for divisibility up to the square root of 7171, as larger factors must be paired with smaller factors. The square root of 7171 is approximately 84.7.

Checking divisibility by 5, we observe that 7171 does not end with a 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Continuing this process, we can check divisibility by primes up to 84, but we find that none divide evenly into 7171.

Next, we can check if 7171 is divisible by any prime numbers up to 84.7. 

Starting with 2, we find that 7171 is not divisible by 2. 

Moving on to 3, we find that the sum of the digits of 7171 is 16, which is not divisible by 3.

To determine if 9271 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can perform a factorization test by dividing 9271 by prime numbers starting from 2. 

We find that when dividing 9271 by 2, there is no remainder. Hence, 2 is a factor of 9271.

9271 ÷ 2 = 4635.5

Since 2 is a factor, we continue dividing 9271 by the next prime number, which is 3.

Again, when dividing 9271 by 3, there is no remainder. Hence, 3 is also a factor of 9271.

To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

To check if 8249 is divisible by a number, we need to divide it by numbers starting from 2 and going up to the square root of 8249 (approximately 90.88). 

So, let's start dividing 8249 by 2:
8249 ÷ 2 = 4124.5

Since the result is not a whole number, we move on to the next number, 3:
8249 ÷ 3 = 2749.666...

Again, the result is not a whole number. We continue with numbers 4, 5, 6, and so on.

But we reach a point where no numbers are able to divide 8249 evenly without any remainder. This means that 8249 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

To determine if 5183 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if 2 is a factor of 5183. We do this by dividing 5183 by 2, and if the result is a whole number, then 2 is a factor. 

5183 ÷ 2 = 2591.5 

Since the result is not a whole number, 2 is not a factor of 5183. 

Next, we can check for other possible factors by dividing 5183 by odd numbers starting from 3, 5, 7, and so on, until the square root of 5183 is reached or a factor is found.

We calculate the square root of 5183:

??183 ??71.99

We only need to check for factors up to 71 because any factor greater than this would have a corresponding factor less than the square root of 5183.

Now, we proceed to check if 3 is a factor:

5183 ÷ 3 = 1727.67

Since the result is not a whole number, 3 is not a factor.

We continue this process with other odd numbers less than or equal to 71.

We find that 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67 do not divide evenly into 5183.

Next, we check if 9797 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 98.98. 

We start with 2, but 9797 is not divisible by 2 since it is an odd number.

Then, we move to the next prime number, 3. By summing up the digits of 9797, we get 9+7+9+7 = 32. Since 32 is divisible by 3 (9+7+9+7 = 32, and 3+2 = 5, which is divisible by 3), we conclude that 9797 is divisible by 3.

To determine if 9797 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If it ends with an even digit, then it is divisible by 2. However, 9797 ends with an odd digit (7), so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To determine this, we can add up all the digits of 9797 and then check if the sum is divisible by 3. 

9 + 7 + 9 + 7 = 32

Since 32 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 9797 is also not divisible by 3.

We can also check if it is divisible by 5. If it ends with a 5 or 0, then it is divisible by 5. However, 9797 does not end with either of these digits, so it is not divisible by 5.

Finally, we can check if it is divisible by 7. This method involves doubling the last digit (7) and subtracting it from the remaining digits of the number. If the difference is divisible by 7, then the number is divisible by 7.

979 - (2 * 7) = 979 - 14 = 965

Since 965 is not divisible by 7, we can conclude that 9797 is not divisible by 7 either.

By checking divisibility with the prime numbers up to the square root of 9797 (which is approximately 98), we can determine that 9797 is not divisible by any other numbers, making it a prime number, not a composite number.

2. Check for divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 3497: The square root of 3497 is approximately 59.083. We will check for divisibility by prime numbers up to 59.

3. Check for divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of 3497 is 3 + 4 + 9 + 7 = 23, which is not divisible by 3. Thus, 3497 is not divisible by 3.

4. Check for divisibility by 5: Since the last digit of 3497 is not 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

5. Check for divisibility by 7: We can use the divisibility rule for 7, which states that if the difference between twice the ones digit and the remaining digits is divisible by 7, then the number is divisible by 7. In this case, twice the ones digit is 7, and the remaining digits are 349. Thus, 2(7) - 349 = -335, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 3497 is not divisible by 7.

6. Check for divisibility by 11: We can use the divisibility rule for 11, which states that if the difference between the sum of alternating digits and the sum of the other alternating digits is divisible by 11, then the number is divisible by 11. In this case, the alternating sums are 3 + 9 = 12 and 4 + 7 = 11. The difference between 12 and 11 is 1, which is not divisible by 11. Thus, 3497 is not divisible by 11.

Next, let's check divisibility by prime numbers up to its square root. We can start with 3. 

2509 divided by 3 gives a quotient of 836 with a remainder of 1. 

Since the remainder is not 0, we can conclude that 2509 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue checking divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 2509, but we can make an observation. 

If a number is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root, then it is a prime number. This is because any composite number can be factored into prime factors, and at least one of those factors must be less than or equal to the square root of the number.

Therefore, we can conclude that 2509 is a prime number.

To determine if 2551 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself.

First, we check if 2551 is divisible by 2. Since it ends in an odd number (1), it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check if 2551 is divisible by 3. By adding up the digits (2 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 13) and checking if the sum is divisible by 3, we conclude that it is not.

To check for divisibility by 5, we check if the number ends in 0 or 5, but 2551 does not, so it is not divisible by 5.

Now, we need to check if 2551 is divisible by any prime numbers between 7 and the square root of 2551 (approximately 50.50). If there is no divisor between these values, then 2551 is prime.

When we test for this, we determine that 2551 is not divisible by any prime numbers between 7 and the square root of 2551.

Starting with 2, we check if 2593 is divisible by 2. Since 2 is not a factor of 2593, we move on. 

Next, we check if 2593 is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 2593 is 2 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 19. Since 19 is not divisible by 3, we conclude that 2593 is not divisible by 3. 

We continue this process for the next prime numbers (5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and so on). 

Step 3: Repeat step 2 until you reach the square root of 2593 (51) or find a factor. 

After testing all prime numbers up to 51, we have determined that 2593 is not divisible by any of them. 

Step 4: Conclude with the result. 

Since we have not found any factor of 2593, we can conclude that 2593 is a prime number.

To determine if 8521 is a prime number, we can follow a step-by-step approach known as trial division:

1. First, we check if 8521 is divisible by 2, the smallest prime number. Since 8521 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 8521 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up the digits of the number: 8 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 16. Since 16 is not divisible by 3, the number 8521 is also not divisible by 3.

3. We continue this process with the remaining prime numbers greater than 3, which are 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc. However, for a number as small as 8521, it is not necessary to check divisibility by all these prime numbers.

4. We could also calculate the square root of 8521, which is approximately 92.32. This means we only need to check divisibility by prime numbers up to 92.

By following these steps, we can conclude that 8521 is a prime number unless it is divisible by a prime number between 2 and 92. However, we would need to perform further calculations and testing to determine if this is the case.

To do this, let's find the square root of 9187, which is approximately 95.952. 

Now, we will check if 9187 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 95.952.

Starting with 2, we can see that 9187 is not divisible by 2.
Next, we check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits in 9187 is 9 + 1 + 8 + 7 = 25, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 9187 is not divisible by 3.

Continuing this process, we can skip checking divisibility by even numbers (such as 4, 6, 8, etc.) as they have already been ruled out by checking divisibility by 2.

Now, let's check divisibility by the next prime number, which is 5. Since the last digit of 9187 is not 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

To determine whether 1523 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. Since 1523 is an odd number and not divisible by 2, we move on to the next possible divisor, which is 3. 

By adding up the digits of 1523 (1 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 11), we see that the sum is not divisible by 3. Therefore, we can eliminate 3 as a possible divisor. 

Next, we check if 1523 is divisible by any prime numbers greater than 3 but less than the square root of 1523. In this case, that number is approximately 39. 

By dividing 1523 by prime numbers from 5 to 37, we can determine that 1523 is not divisible by any of these numbers, which means it is not divisible by any number less than 39.

"Is 2269 a composite number? 
Let's think step by step.","
To determine if a number is composite, we have to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. To do this, we can check if there are any whole numbers that evenly divide 2269.

First, we can check if 2 is a factor of 2269. Since 2 is not a factor of 2269 (2269 divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1), we can move on to the next number, 3.

Next, we can check if 3 is a factor of 2269. Again, 3 is not a factor of 2269 (2269 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1).

We can continue this process and check each number up to the square root of 2269, which is approximately 47.6. Checking up to this point is sufficient because any factor of 2269 larger than the square root would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root.

As we divide 2269 by numbers up to 47.6, we find that none of them evenly divide 2269 without leaving a remainder. Therefore, we can conclude that 2269 is not divisible by any whole numbers other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 2269 is a prime number, not a composite number.
