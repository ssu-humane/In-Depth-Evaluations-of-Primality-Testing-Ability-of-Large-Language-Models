Explanation:
To check if a number is divisible by 61, we need to use the divisibility rule for 61. According to the rule, a number is divisible by 61 if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 61.
In the case of 4331, the alternating sum of its digits is 4 - 3 + 3 - 1 = 3. Since 3 is divisible by 61 (3/61 = 0 with no remainder), we can conclude that 4331 is divisible by 61.

###
Yes, 9617 is a prime number.
###
No, 9617 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
###
To determine if 9617 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.
