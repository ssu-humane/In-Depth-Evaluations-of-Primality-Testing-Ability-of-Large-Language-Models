###
Yes, 53 is a prime number. It is only divisible by 1 and 53 without leaving a remainder.
###
To determine if 53 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

We need to check divisibility up to the square root of 53, which is approximately 7.28.

Now let's check if 53 is divisible by any number from 2 to 7.

53 divided by 2 is not an integer.
53 divided by 3 is not an integer.
53 divided by 4 is not an integer.
53 divided by 5 is not an integer.
53 divided by 6 is not an integer.
53 divided by 7 is also not an integer.

Since 53 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that 53 is a prime number. Therefore, the answer is Yes.
###
No, 53 is not a composite number. It is a prime number because it has exactly two distinct factors: 1 and 53. Composite numbers have more than two factors.
###
To determine if 53 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by trying to divide it by all the whole numbers up to its square root, which is approximately 7.28. 

Upon checking, we find that there are no whole number divisions of 53 other than 1 and 53 itself. 

Therefore, since 53 only has two distinct factors, 1 and 53, it is not divisible by any other numbers, and it is not a composite number. 

53 is a prime number. 

So, the answer is No.
