To determine if 905 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if 905 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 905, which is approximately 30.08.

Starting with 2, we find that 905 is not divisible by 2 since it is an odd number.

Next, we check if 905 is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 905 is 9 + 0 + 5 = 14, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 905 is not divisible by 3.

Moving on to the next prime number, 5, we find that 905 is not divisible by 5 since it does not end in 0 or 5.

After that, we check if 905 is divisible by 7. The difference between twice the last digit of 905 (which is 0) and the remaining digits (90) is 90, which is divisible by 7. Therefore, 905 is divisible by 7.

Since we have found a divisor of 7 for 905, we can conclude that 905 is not a prime number.

Therefore, the answer is No, 905 is not a prime number.
###
No, 905 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 905 is a composite number, we need to find its factors.

The factors of 905 are:
1 and 905
5 and 181

Since 905 has factors other than 1 and itself, specifically 5 and 181, it is not a prime number. Therefore, 905 is a composite number.

So the answer is Yes, 905 is a composite number.
###

###
To determine if 917 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If the last digit of the number is even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), then it is divisible by 2. However, the last digit of 917 is 7, which is odd. Therefore, 917 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any odd numbers less than its square root. We can divide 917 by the prime numbers up to the square root of 917, which is approximately 30.28. 

Dividing 917 by 3, we get a quotient of 305 with a remainder of 2.

Dividing 917 by 5, we get a quotient of 183 with a remainder of 2.

Dividing 917 by 7, we get a quotient of 131 with a remainder of 0.

Since 917 is divisible by 7, it is not a prime number.

Therefore, 917 is not a prime number.

###
To determine if 922 is a prime number, we can again check if it is divisible by any whole number from 2 to the square root of 922 (rounded up to the nearest whole number).

The square root of 922 is approximately 30.38, so we'll check for divisibility by the numbers 2 to 30.

Starting with 2, we see that 922 is not divisible by 2 since it is an even number.

Next, we move on to 3. Adding up the digits of 922 (9 + 2 + 2), we get 13. Since 13 is not divisible by 3, 922 is also not divisible by 3.

Continuing with the same pattern of checking divisibility for all the remaining numbers up to 30, we find that 922 is not divisible by any of them.

Therefore, 922 is a prime number.
###
No, 922 is not a prime number.

To determine if 926 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 926 is an even number (divisible by 2), we can conclude that 926 is not a prime number.

Therefore, the answer is No. 926 is not a prime number.
###
No, 926 is not a prime number. It is a composite number.
###
To determine if 926 is a composite number, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, let's factorize the number 926.

We can start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Evaluating this division, we find that 926 divided by 2 equals 463, with no remainder.

Now, let's check if 926 is divisible by any other prime numbers. We can try dividing it by 3, 5, 7, and so on, but since 926 is already divisible by 2, we can conclude that it is not a prime number.

Therefore, the number 926 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.

To determine if 933 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2
Since 933 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Step 2: Check divisibility by numbers up to √933
The square root of 933 is approximately 30.54. We will check divisibility by numbers up to 30.

933 is not divisible by 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, or 30.

Therefore, 933 is a prime number.
###
No, 933 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 933 is a composite number.

To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

For 933, we can find the factors by dividing it by smaller numbers and checking for remainders.

By trying out a few numbers, we find that 3 is a factor of 933. Dividing 933 by 3 gives us 311, which is a whole number.

So, 3 is a factor of 933, but 933 is not divisible by any other numbers except 1 and itself.

Therefore, 933 is also a composite number.

###
Yes.
###
Yes.
###
No, 573 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3 and 191.
###
To determine if 427 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if 427 is divisible by 2. If the number ends in an even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), it is divisible by 2. However, since 427 ends in 7 (an odd digit), it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if 427 is divisible by 3. We sum up the digits of 427: 4 + 2 + 7 = 13. Since 13 is not divisible by 3, 427 is also not divisible by 3.

We can continue checking for divisibility by other prime numbers, but since 427 is not divisible by 2 or 3, we already know that it is not divisible by any smaller primes. 

Therefore, 427 is a prime number.
###
No.
###

One way to do this is to check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to its square root.

The square root of 951 is approximately 30.82.

Now, let's check if 951 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 30.

By testing divisibility, we find that 951 is divisible by 3 since 951 ÷ 3 = 317.

Therefore, 951 is not a prime number as it has a factor other than 1 and itself.

Hence, 951 is a composite number.

To determine if 955 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. We can do this by finding all the possible factors of 955.
###
No.
###
To determine if 955 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, let's find the prime factors of 955.

The prime factorization of 955 can be found by dividing it by prime numbers starting from 2.

955 ÷ 2 = 477.5   (not divisible)

955 ÷ 3 = 318.33  (not divisible)

955 ÷ 5 = 191      (not divisible)

955 ÷ 7 = 136.43  (not divisible)

955 ÷ 11 = 86.82  (not divisible)

955 ÷ 13 = 73.46  (not divisible)

We can see that 955 does not have any prime factors other than 1 and itself, so it does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 955 is a prime number and not a composite number.

No
###

Yes. 581 is divisible by 83.
###
No, 586 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2 and 293.
###
To determine if 445 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 445 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check divisibility by other prime numbers such as 3, 5, 7, etc. By trying each number, we find that 445 is not divisible by any of these primes.

Therefore, 445 is a prime number.
###

###
No, 958 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 and itself. For example, it can be divided by 2 to give a quotient of 479.
###
To determine if 958 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. We can do this by factoring 958.

First, let's check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit of 958 is not even, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. Adding all the digits of 958, we get 9 + 5 + 8 = 22. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, we know that 958 is not divisible by 3.

Similarly, we can check if it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit of 958 is not 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

We can also check if it is divisible by 7. However, the sum of the first digit minus twice the last digit (9 - 2*8) is not divisible by 7.

Since we have checked all the prime numbers up to the square root of 958 and found no factors, we can conclude that 958 is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 958 is not a composite number.
###
Yes.

No, 614 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2 and 307.
###
To determine if 447 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2
Since 447 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Step 2: Check divisibility by odd numbers up to the square root of 447
Dividing 447 by odd numbers starting from 3, we find that it is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 9, and so on. 

Therefore, 447 is a prime number.

Answer: No
###
No, 447 is not a prime number. It can be factored as 3 x 149, so it has factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, it is composite.
###
Yes
###

###
No, 106 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2 and 53.
###
To determine if 959 is a prime number, we will check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check for Divisibility by 2
Since the last digit of 959 is 9, which is an odd number, we know that 959 is not divisible by 2.

Step 2: Check for Divisibility by 3
The sum of the digits of 959 is 9 + 5 + 9 = 23. Since 23 is not divisible by 3, we know that 959 is not divisible by 3.

Step 3: Check for Divisibility by 5
Since the last digit of 959 is not 0 or 5, we know that 959 is not divisible by 5.

Step 4: Check for Divisibility by 7
To check for divisibility by 7, we can use the following rule: "Double the last digit and subtract it from the number without the last digit. If the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7."

Double the last digit (9 x 2 = 18), then subtract it from the number without the last digit (95 - 18 = 77). Since 77 is divisible by 7, we know that 959 is divisible by 7.

Therefore, 959 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 7, 137, and 959.

Hope this helps!

First, we can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If the number ends in an even digit, it is divisible by 2. Since 453 ends in 3, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any primes up to the square root of 453, which is approximately 21.3.

Checking for divisibility by primes less than 21.3:

- 3: 453 ÷ 3 = 151, not divisible
- 5: 453 ÷ 5 = 90.6, not divisible
- 7: 453 ÷ 7 = 64.7, not divisible
- 11: 453 ÷ 11 = 41.2, not divisible
- 13: 453 ÷ 13 = 34.8, not divisible
- 17: 453 ÷ 17 = 26.6, not divisible
- 19: 453 ÷ 19 = 23.8, not divisible

Since 453 is not divisible by any primes less than 21.3, we can conclude that 453 is a prime number.

So, the answer is YES, 453 is a prime number.
###
No, 453 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 453 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Starting with 1, we can divide 453 by 1: 

453 ÷ 1 = 453, which gives us a quotient of 453.

Now, let's check if 453 is divisible by any other numbers. We can try dividing it by 2:

453 ÷ 2 = 226.5, which does not give us a quotient as a whole number.

We can continue checking with other numbers, but as we have already found a factor of 2 (besides 1 and 453), we can conclude that 453 is not a composite number.

Therefore, the answer is no, 453 is not a composite number.

To determine if 965 is a prime number, we can start by checking its divisibility by smaller prime numbers.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit of 965 is 5, which is odd, 965 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check if 965 is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 965 is 9 + 6 + 5 = 20, and 20 is not divisible by 3. Thus, 965 is not divisible by 3.

Moving on, we check if 965 is divisible by 5. Since the last digit of 965 is 5, it is divisible by 5.

Therefore, 965 is not a prime number, as it is divisible by 5.
###
Yes.
###
To determine whether 965 is a composite number, we need to check if it can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit of 965 is 5 and not even, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check divisibility by all prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 965. The square root of 965 is approximately 31.08. Let's check the prime numbers less than or equal to 31:

- 965 is not divisible by 2 (as we already checked).
- 965 is not divisible by 3, as the sum of its digits (9 + 6 + 5) is 20, not divisible by 3.
- 965 is not divisible by 5, as it does not end in 0 or 5.
- 965 is not divisible by 7, as 965 ÷ 7 = 137.86, which is not an integer.
- 965 is not divisible by 11, as 965 ÷ 11 = 87.727..., which is not an integer.
- 965 is divisible by 13, as 965 ÷ 13 = 74 with no remainder.

Since we have found a prime number less than or equal to the square root of 965 that evenly divides it (13), we can conclude that 965 is a composite number.

Let's start by checking if 469 is divisible by 2. If we divide 469 by 2, we get 234 remainder 1. Since there is a remainder, 469 is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check if 469 is divisible by 3. Adding up the digits of 469, we get 4 + 6 + 9 = 19. Since 19 is not divisible by 3, we know that 469 is not divisible by 3.

Similarly, we can check if 469 is divisible by 4, 5, 6, and so on, until we reach the square root of 469. However, it is not necessary to check all these numbers as we can notice that 469 is not divisible by any prime number less than its square root.

Therefore, we can conclude that 469 is a prime number. Answer: Yes.

To find the factors of 471, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers. We can begin by dividing it by 2.

471 ÷ 2 = 235.5

Since 471 is not divisible by 2, we move on to the next prime number, which is 3.

471 ÷ 3 = 157

Since 471 is not divisible by 3, we try the next prime number, which is 5.

471 ÷ 5 = 94.2

Again, 471 is not divisible by 5, so we move on to the next prime number, which is 7.

471 ÷ 7 = 67.2857

Still, 471 is not divisible by 7. We continue to check the divisibility by prime numbers higher than 7, but since 471 is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that it doesn't have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 471 is a composite number.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. Summing the digits of 993 gives 9 + 9 + 3 = 21, and since 21 is divisible by 3, we know that 993 is also divisible by 3.

Therefore, 993 is not a prime number as it has other divisors apart from 1 and itself. Thus, the answer is No.
###
No, 993 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 993 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. 

We can check its divisibility by numbers starting from 2 up to the square root of 993, which is approximately 31.5.

Checking divisibility by 2, 993 is not divisible by 2 as it is an odd number.

###
No, 662 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 2, 331, and also other numbers.
###
To check if 502 is a prime number, we follow the same process as before.

First, divide 502 by 2:
502 ÷ 2 = 251

Since 251 is a whole number, we can conclude that 502 is not divisible by 2. We move on to the next possible factor, which is 3.

Next, divide 502 by 3:
502 ÷ 3 ≈ 167.33

167.33 is not a whole number. We continue the process with the next factor, which is 4.

Divide 502 by 4:
502 ÷ 4 = 125.5

125.5 is not a whole number either. We proceed with the next factor, which is 5.

Divide 502 by 5:
502 ÷ 5 = 100.4

100.4 is not a whole number. We continue this process until we reach the square root of 502, which is approximately 22.41.

Divide 502 by 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, etc., all the way up to 22. Since none of these divisions result in a whole number, we can conclude that 502 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

505 is divisible by 5: 505 ÷ 5 = 101.

505 is also divisible by 101: 505 ÷ 101 = 5.

Therefore, 505 is not a prime number because it has factors other than 1 and itself (101 and 5). 
The answer is No.
###

###
To determine whether 158 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

One way to do this is by dividing 158 by every number from 2 to the square root of 158 (rounded up to the nearest whole number).

Let's proceed with the division:

158 ÷ 2 = 79

Since 79 is a prime number and it is the result of the division, we can conclude that 158 is not a prime number.

To summarize, 158 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2 and 79.
###
Yes, 158 is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has at least one divisor other than 1 and itself. In the case of 158, it can be divided by 2 and 79, in addition to 1 and 158.
