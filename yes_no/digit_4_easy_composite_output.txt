To check if 7858 is a prime number, we will divide it by all possible divisors up to the square root of 7858, which is approximately 88.604. 

Starting from the smallest prime number (2), we will divide 7858 by each number up to 88. If any of these divisions result in an integer quotient, then 7858 is not a prime number.

However, since 7858 is an even number (ends with a 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), we can conclude that it is divisible by 2. Therefore, 7858 is not a prime number.
