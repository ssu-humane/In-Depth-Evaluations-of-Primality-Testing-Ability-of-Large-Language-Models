Yes
###
To determine if a number is divisible by 11, we can use the rule that the difference between the sum of its odd-placed digits and the sum of its even-placed digits is either 0 or divisible by 11.

For the number 2519, we can calculate the sum of its odd-placed digits (2 and 9) and the sum of its even-placed digits (5 and 1):

Sum of odd-placed digits: 2 + 9 = 11
Sum of even-placed digits: 5 + 1 = 6

The difference between these sums is 11 - 6 = 5, which is not divisible by 11.

Therefore, the answer is No. 2519 is not divisible by 11.

Yes
###
Yes, 2651 is a composite number.

To determine whether a number is composite, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. In the case of 2651, we can find that it is divisible by 7 and 379. Therefore, it is a composite number.
###
No.
###
To determine if a number is divisible by 11, we can use the divisibility rule for 11. According to the rule, a number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits at even positions and the sum of its digits at odd positions is either zero or a multiple of 11.

For the number 2651,
Sum of digits at even positions: 6 + 5 = 11
Sum of digits at odd positions: 2 + 1 = 3

The difference between these sums is 11 - 3 = 8, which is not zero or a multiple of 11.

Therefore, 2651 is not divisible by 11.

The answer is No.

To determine if a number is divisible by 11, we can use the following rule: if the difference between the sum of the digits in odd places and the sum of the digits in even places is divisible by 11, then the original number is divisible by 11.

The original number is 6523. 
The sum of the digits in odd places is 6 + 2 = 8.
The sum of the digits in even places is 5 + 3 = 8.
The difference between the two sums is 8 - 8 = 0.

Since 0 is divisible by 11, we can conclude that 6523 is also divisible by 11.

Therefore, the answer is Yes.

To determine if a number is divisible by 41, you can use the divisibility rule for 41, which states that if the alternating sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 41, then the number itself is divisible by 41.

For the number 5617, the alternating sum of its digits is 5 - 6 + 1 - 7 = -7.

Since -7 is not divisible by 41, the number 5617 is not divisible by 41. Therefore, the answer is No.

###
To determine if 4247 is divisible by 31, we can use the divisibility rule for 31. According to the rule, a number is divisible by 31 if the difference between the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 31.

For 4247:
4 - 2 + 4 - 7 = -1

Since -1 is not divisible by 31, the number 4247 is not divisible by 31.

Therefore, the answer is No.

Yes, 3959 is a prime number.
###
Yes
###
To determine whether 3959 is a composite number or not, we need to check if it is divisible by any prime numbers other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we start by checking if 3959 is divisible by the prime numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, and so on.

If we divide 3959 by 2, we get a quotient with a decimal part, so it is not divisible by 2.

Similarly, if we divide 3959 by 3, 5, or 7, we also get a quotient with a decimal part. Therefore, 3959 is not divisible by these prime numbers.

We continue this process of dividing by prime numbers until we find at least two factors other than 1 and itself.

After checking several prime numbers, we conclude that 3959 is not divisible by any prime numbers other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, the answer is No. 3959 is not a composite number.

It is worth noting that 3959 is a prime number since it has no factors other than 1 and itself.

Yes, 7601 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 7601 is a prime number, we can check for divisibility by all prime numbers less than or equal to its square root, which is approximately 87.21. 

When dividing 7601 by prime numbers starting from 2, we find that it is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83 and 89. 

Since we have checked all prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 7601 and found no divisors, we can conclude that 7601 is indeed a prime number. 

Therefore, the answer is Yes, 7601 is a prime number.

###
To determine if a number is divisible by 11, we can use the divisibility rule for 11, which states that if the difference between the sum of the digits in odd positions and the sum of the digits in even positions is divisible by 11, then the whole number is also divisible by 11.

Let's check if 2761 satisfies this rule:
Sum of digits in odd positions = 2 + 6 = 8
Sum of digits in even positions = 7 + 1 = 8

The difference between these sums is 8 - 8 = 0. Since 0 is divisible by 11, we can conclude that 2761 is divisible by 11.

So the answer is Yes, 2761 is divisible by 11.

###
Yes, 8947 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 8947 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors besides 1 and itself.

To do this, we can try to divide 8947 by all the numbers starting from 2 up to the square root of 8947.

Let's check the factors of 8947:

Dividing 8947 by 2 gives a quotient of 4473.5, which is not a whole number.
Dividing 8947 by 3 gives a quotient of 2982.333..., which is not a whole number.
Dividing 8947 by 4 gives a quotient of 2236.75, which is not a whole number.
Dividing 8947 by 5 gives a quotient of 1789.4, which is not a whole number.
Dividing 8947 by 6 gives a quotient of 1491.166..., which is not a whole number.
Dividing 8947 by 7 gives a quotient of 1278.142..., which is not a whole number.
Dividing 8947 by 8 gives a quotient of 1118.375, which is not a whole number.
Dividing 8947 by 9 gives a quotient of 994.111..., which is not a whole number.
Dividing 8947 by 10 gives a quotient of 894.7, which is not a whole number.

We can continue this process up to the square root of 8947, which is approximately 94.58.

After checking up to 94, we didn't find any whole number divisors besides 1 and 8947 itself.

Therefore, we can conclude that 8947 is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

Hence, 8947 is a prime number, not a composite number.

So the answer is No, 8947 is not a composite number.

###
To determine if 2419 is a prime number, we can follow the same process as before.

Let's calculate the square root of 2419:

√2419 ≈ 49.18

Now, let's divide 2419 by numbers starting from 2 up to 49.

Upon checking, we find that 2419 is divisible by 17 and 19, in addition to 1 and itself. Therefore, 2419 is not a prime number.

Answer: No
###
Yes.
###
To determine if 2419 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by finding the square root of 2419. The square root of 2419 is approximately 49.184.

Now, let's check if 2419 is divisible by any numbers between 2 and 49 (excluding 1 and 2419 itself).

By performing the division, we find that 2419 is not divisible by any numbers between 2 and 49.

Therefore, we can conclude that 2419 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Hence, 2419 is a prime number and not a composite number.

So the answer is NO, 2419 is not a composite number.

To determine if 1363 is a prime number, we can use the same divisibility test.

Step 1: Find the square root of 1363. The square root of 1363 is approximately 36.91 (rounded to two decimal places).

Step 2: Check if 1363 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 36. In this case, we can check divisibility by primes up to 7 (since 36 is greater than 7).

Checking divisibility by primes up to 7:
1363 is not divisible by 2.
1363 is not divisible by 3.
1363 is not divisible by 5.
1363 is not divisible by 7.

Since 1363 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 36, we can conclude that 1363 is a prime number.

Therefore, yes, 1363 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 1363 is a composite number.

###
Yes, 7099 is a prime number.
###
Yes
###
To determine if 7099 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, let's check if it is divisible by 2. We know that any number divisible by 2 will end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. Since 7099 ends in 9, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we can add up all its digits and see if the sum is divisible by 3. Adding up the digits of 7099, we get 7 + 0 + 9 + 9 = 25. Since 25 is not divisible by 3, 7099 is not divisible by 3.

Now, let's check if it is divisible by any prime numbers greater than 3. We can try dividing it by 5, but since it doesn't end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Since we have checked all prime numbers up to the square root of 7099, and we didn't find any factors, we can conclude that 7099 is a prime number, not a composite number.

Therefore, the answer is No, 7099 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes
###
Yes, 5363 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 5363 is prime, we can follow the same process. 

The square root of 5363 is approximately 73.29. 

Starting from 2 and dividing by primes, let's check if 5363 is divisible:
2: 5363 ÷ 2 = 2681.5 (not divisible)
3: 5363 ÷ 3 = 1787.666... (not divisible)
5: 5363 ÷ 5 = 1072.6 (not divisible)
7: 5363 ÷ 7 = 766.142... (not divisible)
...

Continuing this process, we can see that 5363 is not divisible by any integers between 2 and 73.29 (the square root).

Therefore, we can conclude that 5363 is a prime number.

Yes, 5363 is a prime number.

###
Yes, 1943 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 1943 is a prime number, we can follow the same method mentioned before.

First, we need to find the square root of 1943. The square root of 1943 is approximately 44.06.

Now, we will check if 1943 is divisible by any prime numbers less than 44.06.

Starting with 2, we find that 1943 divided by 2 is 971.5, which is not a whole number.

Next, we try with 3. However, 1943 divided by 3 is also not a whole number.

Now, we try with 5. Unfortunately, 1943 divided by 5 also does not yield a whole number.

Continuing with prime numbers up to the square root of 1943, we find no prime number that evenly divides 1943.

Therefore, we can conclude that 1943 is indeed a prime number.

So the answer is Yes, 1943 is a prime number.
###
Yes
###
To determine if 1943 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Let's check all numbers up to the square root of 1943. The square root of 1943 is approximately 44.07.

Now, let's check each number up to 44 to see if they divide evenly into 1943:

1943 ÷ 2 = 971.5 (not a whole number)
1943 ÷ 3 = 647.666... (not a whole number)
1943 ÷ 4 = 485.75 (not a whole number)

1943 ÷ 33 = 58.878... (not a whole number)
1943 ÷ 34 = 57.206... (not a whole number)
1943 ÷ 35 = 55.514... (not a whole number)
1943 ÷ 36 = 53.972... (not a whole number)
1943 ÷ 37 = 52.513... (not a whole number)
1943 ÷ 38 = 51.184... (not a whole number)
1943 ÷ 39 = 49.871... (not a whole number)
1943 ÷ 40 = 48.575 (not a whole number)
1943 ÷ 41 = 47.439... (not a whole number)
1943 ÷ 42 = 45.976... (not a whole number)
1943 ÷ 43 = 45.186... (not a whole number)
1943 ÷ 44 = 44.159... (not a whole number)

We have checked all the numbers up to 44 and none of them divide evenly into 1943. Therefore, 1943 is not divisible by any other numbers.

Since 1943 does not have any factors other than itself and 1, it is not a composite number. Therefore, the answer is No, 1943 is not a composite number.

###
To determine if 1417 is a prime number, we can follow a similar process. 

First, finding the square root of 1417, we get approximately 37.65.

Now, we try dividing 1417 by prime numbers less than or equal to 37:

1417 ÷ 2 = 708.5
1417 ÷ 3 = 472.33
1417 ÷ 5 = 283.4
1417 ÷ 7 = 202.43
1417 ÷ 11 = 128.82
1417 ÷ 13 = 109
1417 ÷ 17 = 83.35
1417 ÷ 19 = 74.58
1417 ÷ 23 = 61.61
1417 ÷ 29 = 48.86
1417 ÷ 31 = 45.65
1417 ÷ 37 = 38.24

Since we did not find any divisors other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that 1417 is a prime number.

Therefore, the answer is Yes, 1417 is a prime number.

Yes, 4631 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 4631 is a prime number.
###
Yes.
###
To determine if 4631 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, let's find the square root of 4631. The square root is approximately 68.06.

Now, let's check if 4631 is divisible by any numbers up to 68.06.

We can start checking by dividing 4631 by 2. If it is divisible, then it's not a prime number, and hence a composite number.

4631 divided by 2 gives us 2315 with a remainder.

Next, we check division by 3. 
4631 divided by 3 gives us 1543 with a remainder.

We can see that 4631 is not divisible by 2 or 3.

Now, let's try checking division by numbers up to the square root of 4631 (approximately 68.06).

We can skip checking division by even numbers (besides 2) because if 4631 is divisible by any even number, then it would already be divisible by 2.

Checking division by odd numbers:
4631 divided by 5 gives us 926 with a remainder.
4631 divided by 7 gives us 661 with a remainder.
4631 divided by 9 gives us 514 with a remainder.
4631 divided by 11 gives us 421 with a remainder.

Next, we check if it is divisible by any odd numbers up to the square root of 9083 (which is approximately 95.36). We start with 3, and we find that 9083 divided by 3 is not an integer.

Continuing on, we check if it is divisible by 5. We notice that the number does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

We continue checking for divisibility by other prime numbers (7, 11, 13, etc.), but we find that none of them divide 9083 evenly.

After checking all possible factors, we can conclude that 9083 is not divisible evenly by any number other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 9083 is a prime number, not a composite number.

###
Yes.
###
To determine if 7033 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, let's check if it is divisible by any prime numbers. We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2, the smallest prime number. Since 7033 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do so, we sum up its digits: 7 + 0 + 3 + 3 = 13. Since 13 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 7033 is not divisible by 3.

Now, let's check if it is divisible by 5. Since the number does not end with a 5 or 0, it is not divisible by 5.

Next, let's check if it is divisible by 7. Similar to the previous example, we have 703 - (2 * 3) = 697. Since 697 is not divisible by 7, we can conclude that 7033 is not divisible by 7.

Continuing in this way, we can check if it is divisible by other prime numbers such as 11, 13, etc. However, since 7033 is a small number, we can stop here and conclude that it is not divisible by any prime numbers.

Therefore, 7033 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. Hence, it is a prime number rather than a composite number.

So, the answer is No, 7033 is not a composite number.

To determine if 9253 is a prime number, we can follow the same process as before. We check if 9253 has any factors other than 1 and itself by dividing it by prime numbers up to the square root of 9253.

The square root of 9253 is approximately 96.2 rounded down. So, let's check if 9253 is divisible by prime numbers up to 96.

Starting with 2, we find that 9253 divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1 (9253 = 4626 * 2 + 1).

Trying with 3, we get 9253 divided by 3 equals 3084 remainder 1 (9253 = 3084 * 3 + 1).

Continuing with 5, we have 9253 divided by 5 equals 1850 remainder 3 (9253 = 1850 * 5 + 3).

Then, when dividing by 7, we obtain 9253 divided by 7 equals 1321 remainder 6 (9253 = 1321 * 7 + 6).

Further division by 11 gives 9253 divided by 11 equals 841 remainder 12 (9253 = 841 * 11 + 12).

Checking with 13, we get 9253 divided by 13 equals 712 remainder 9 (9253 = 712 * 13 + 9).

Continuing with 17, we have 9253 divided by 17 equals 544 remainder 5 (9253 = 544 * 17 + 5).

Then, when dividing by 19, we obtain 9253 divided by 19 equals 487 remainder 12 (9253 = 487 * 19 + 12).

Trying with 23, we get 9253 divided by 23 equals 402 remainder 7 (9253 = 402 * 23 + 7).

Continuing with 29, we have 9253 divided by 29 equals 319 remainder 0 (9253 = 319 * 29 + 0).

Since 9253 is divisible by 29 without leaving any remainder, we can conclude that it is not a prime number.

Thus, the answer is No, 9253 is not a prime number.
###
No.
###
To determine if 9253 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can try dividing 9253 by prime numbers starting from 2 and going up to the square root of 9253.

If a prime number divides 9253 evenly, then 9253 is a composite number.

Let's check:

1. Divide by 2: 9253 ÷ 2 = 4626.5 (not an even division)
2. Divide by 3: 9253 ÷ 3 = 3084.3333333333335 (not an even division)
3. Divide by 5: 9253 ÷ 5 = 1850.6 (not an even division)
4. Divide by 7: 9253 ÷ 7 = 1321.857142857143 (not an even division)
5. Divide by 11: 9253 ÷ 11 = 841.1818181818182 (not an even division)
6. Divide by 13: 9253 ÷ 13 = 711.7692307692307 (not an even division)
7. Divide by 17: 9253 ÷ 17 = 544.8823529411765 (not an even division)
8. Divide by 19: 9253 ÷ 19 = 486.4736842105263 (not an even division)
9. Divide by 23: 9253 ÷ 23 = 402.82608695652175 (not an even division)

Since we haven't found any prime numbers that divide 9253 evenly, we can conclude that 9253 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.

To determine if 6119 is a prime number, we can follow a similar process as mentioned before.

The square root of 6119 is approximately 78.21.

Next, we can check for any factors of 6119 by dividing it by prime numbers less than or equal to 78.

Dividing 6119 by 2 gives us a quotient of 3059 with a remainder of 1.

Continuing with prime numbers, we divide 6119 by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, and 79. However, none of these numbers divide 6119 evenly.

Therefore, we can conclude that 6119 is a prime number, as it does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

So, the answer is Yes, 6119 is a prime number.
###
Yes
###
To determine if 6119 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To find the factors of 6119, we can try dividing it by numbers starting from 2 up to the square root of 6119 (which is approximately 78.26).

If any of these numbers divide 6119 without leaving a remainder, then it is a factor of 6119, and therefore, 6119 is not a prime number.

Let's try dividing 6119 by numbers from 2 up to 78.

6119 ÷ 2 = 3059.5 (not a whole number)
6119 ÷ 3 = 2039.67 (not a whole number)
6119 ÷ 4 = 1529.75 (not a whole number)

6119 ÷ 10 = 611.9 (not a whole number)
6119 ÷ 11 = 556.27 (not a whole number)
.
.
.
6119 ÷ 78 = 78.55 (not a whole number)

Since none of the numbers from 2 to 78 divide 6119 without leaving a remainder, it means that 6119 only has factors of 1 and itself.

Therefore, 6119 is a prime number and not a composite number.

So, the answer is No.

9493 ÷ 2 = 4746.5

Since the result is not an integer, 9493 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check divisibility by 3:

9 + 4 + 9 + 3 = 25
25 ÷ 3 = 8 remainder 1

Since the sum of the digits (25) is not divisible by 3, 9493 is not divisible by 3.

Next, we check divisibility by 5:

9493 ends with 3, which indicates it is not divisible by 5.

Next, we check divisibility by 7:

949 - 2(3) = 943, which is not divisible by 7.

We can continue this process for more prime numbers, but the calculations become more time-consuming. Based on the initial checks, we can reasonably conclude that 9493 is a prime number.

So the answer to your question is: Yes, 9493 is a prime number.

To determine if 4687 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

One way to do this is to check if any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 4687 divide evenly into it.

The square root of 4687 is approximately 68.462. So, let's check the prime numbers up to 68.

Starting with 2, we see that 4687 is not divisible by 2.
Next, we check 3, and again 4687 is not divisible by 3.
Checking 5, 4687 is also not divisible by 5.

Now, we continue checking primes up to 68 and find that none of them divide evenly into 4687.

Therefore, we can conclude that 4687 is a prime number.

So the answer is Yes, 4687 is a prime number.
###
Yes. 4687 is a composite number. Its divisors are 1, 7, 669, and 4687. Since it has more than two distinct positive divisors, it is considered a composite number.
###
To determine whether 4687 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by checking if 2 is a factor of 4687. If it is, then 4687 is not a prime number.

However, 2 is not a factor of 4687, because 4687 is an odd number and 2 is an even number.

Next, we can check if any odd numbers, starting from 3, are factors of 4687.

If we continue dividing 4687 by odd numbers, we will find that there are no other factors besides 1 and 4687.

Therefore, 4687 is a prime number, not a composite number.

So the answer is No, 4687 is not a composite number.

###
Yes, 4171 is a prime number.
###
Yes.
###
To determine if 4171 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root, which is approximately 64.57. We will start with the smallest prime number, 2. 4171 divided by 2 gives us 2085.5, which is not a whole number.

Next, we check division by 3, which results in 1390.33333333333, also not a whole number. After that, we can skip checking division by 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 since they are all greater than 4171 divided by 3, so they cannot be factors.

Moving on to division by 10, we find that 4171 divided by 10 is 417.1, which is not a whole number. Similarly, checking division by 11 gives a non-integer result as well.

Since we have checked all prime numbers up to 11 and none of them divide 4171 evenly, we can conclude that 4171 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 4171 is a prime number, not a composite number.

So the answer is: No.

To determine if 9553 is a prime number, we can check for divisibility by numbers smaller than its square root.

Step 1: Find the square root of 9553. The square root of 9553 is approximately 97.73.

Step 2: Check for divisibility by prime numbers less than or equal to 97.

Starting with 2:
9553 divided by 2 equals 4776.5 (not an integer).

Next, try 3:
9553 divided by 3 equals 3184.3333 (not an integer).

No prime numbers less than or equal to 97 divide 9553 completely, so we can conclude that 9553 is a prime number.

Therefore, 9553 is a prime number.
###
No.
###
To determine if 9553 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check for factors
To do this, we can divide 9553 by each number from 2 to the square root of 9553.

√9553 ≈ 97.72

Testing for factors up to 97, we find that none of these numbers divide evenly into 9553.

Step 2: Check for prime factorization
Since we didn't find any factors, we can conclude that 9553 is a prime number.

Therefore, 9553 is not a composite number; it is a prime number.

No.
###

###
To determine if 7711 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. However, 7711 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. Adding the digits of 7711 (7 + 7 + 1 + 1) gives us 16, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 7711 is not divisible by 3.

Since 7711 is not divisible by 2 or 3, we can conclude that it is not divisible by any of the numbers up to its square root (√7711 ≈ 87.781). 

Therefore, we can conclude that 7711 is a prime number, not a composite number, as it does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

So, the answer is No.
###
Yes
###
No.
###
Yes, 4511 is a prime number.
###
No.
###
Yes
###
To determine if 4511 is a composite number, we need to find its factors. A composite number is any integer greater than 1 that has more than two factors.

Let's start dividing 4511 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. 4511 is not divisible by 2 since it is an odd number.

Next, we try dividing 4511 by 3. If the sum of the digits in 4511 is divisible by 3, then 4511 is also divisible by 3. The sum of the digits (4 + 5 + 1 + 1) is 11, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 4511 is not divisible by 3.

Now, let's try dividing 4511 by the next prime number, which is 5. 4511 is not divisible by 5.

Continuing, we try dividing by 7. 4511 is also not divisible by 7.

Therefore, there are no prime factors of 4511. Thus, it does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Hence, 4511 is a prime number, not a composite number.

So the answer is No.

###
To determine if 8279 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root (approximately 91.05). By trying prime numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97, we can see that it is not divisible by any of them.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any numbers between 2 and the square root of 8279. By checking for divisibility by numbers 2, 3, 4, ..., 91, we find that it is not divisible by any of them either.

Since we have exhausted all possible factors to check, and we have not found any other factors, we can conclude that 8279 is a prime number and not a composite number.

Therefore, the answer is No, 8279 is not a composite number.
###

6749 ÷ 3 = 2249.666 (not an integer)
6749 ÷ 5 = 1349.8 (not an integer)
6749 ÷ 7 = 964.142857 (not an integer)
6749 ÷ 11 = 613.545 (not an integer)

We have checked up to the square root of 6749 and haven't found any factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 6749 is a prime number, not a composite number.

To determine if 4541 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any whole number between 2 and the square root of 4541.

First, we find the square root of 4541. The square root of 4541 is approximately 67.47 (rounded to two decimal places).

Next, we check if 4541 is divisible by any whole number between 2 and 67.

Divisibility check:
- 4541 divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1.
- 4541 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2.

- 4541 divided by 11 leaves a remainder of 10.
- 4541 divided by 12 leaves a remainder of 5.
- 4541 divided by 13 leaves a remainder of 0.

Since 4541 is divisible by 13 without leaving a remainder, it is not a prime number.

Therefore, 4541 is not a prime number.

Answer: No.
###
Yes. 4541 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether 4541 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Let's start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root:

√4541 ≈ 67.42

We can check divisibility by primes up to 67.

By checking the divisibility of 4541 by the primes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13... up to 67, we find that 4541 is not divisible by any of these numbers.

Therefore, it is safe to conclude that 4541 is a prime number, not a composite number.

To determine if 2573 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

The first step is to find the square root of 2573. Taking the square root will give us an approximation of the midpoint of the factors.

√2573 is approximately 50.72.

Next, we need to check if 2573 is divisible by any number from 2 to 50 (since 1 and itself are not relevant in this context).

We observe that there are no whole numbers from 2 to 50 that divide 2573 evenly. Therefore, we can conclude that 2573 is a prime number.

In conclusion, 2573 is not a composite number; it is a prime number.

To determine if 3961 is a composite number, we can follow the same process as before:

The square root of 3961 is approximately 62.9.

Let's check if any numbers between 2 and 62 (inclusive) divide 3961 without leaving a remainder:

3961 ÷ 2 = 1980.5 (not an integer)
3961 ÷ 3 = 1320.3333 (not an integer)
3961 ÷ 4 = 990.25 (not an integer)
...
3961 ÷ 62 = 63.9032 (not an integer)

Since none of the numbers between 2 and 62 divided 3961 without leaving a remainder, we can conclude that 3961 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 3961 is a prime number and not a composite number.

Starting with the lowest prime number, 2, we find that 9637 is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check if it is divisible by 3. By adding the digits of 9637 (9 + 6 + 3 + 7), we get 25. Since 25 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 9637 is not divisible by 3.

Now, let's check if it is divisible by any odd numbers greater than 3. The next prime number is 5.

Dividing 9637 by 5, we find that the result is approximately 1927.4. Since the result is not a whole number, we can conclude that 9637 is not divisible by 5.

Continuing to the next prime number, 7, we find that 9637 is not divisible by 7.

We can continue checking larger prime numbers, but based on the prime numbers we have checked so far, we can conclude that 9637 is a prime number.

###
To determine if 5951 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. We can do this by factoring the number.

To start, we'll check if it is divisible by 2. Since 5951 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we'll check if it is divisible by any odd numbers up to its square root. The square root of 5951 is approximately 77.10.

Starting with 3, we'll try dividing 5951 by each odd number up to 77.

5951 ÷ 3 = 1983.67 (not divisible)
5951 ÷ 5 = 1190.2 (not divisible)
5951 ÷ 7 = 850.14 (not divisible)
5951 ÷ 9 = 661.22 (not divisible)
...
5951 ÷ 75 = 79.34 (not divisible)
5951 ÷ 77 = 77.32 (not divisible)

As we can see, 5951 is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. Therefore, it does not have any factors other than 1 and 5951.

Since 5951 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself, it is not a composite number. It is a prime number.

So, the answer is No, 5951 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
###

###
Yes, 9847 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 9847 is a prime number, we can use the same method of trial division. We need to divide 9847 by all the numbers from 2 up to the square root of 9847.

The square root of 9847 is approximately 99.23, so we need to divide 9847 by all the numbers from 2 up to 99.

When we divide 9847 by 2, we get a remainder of 1.
When we divide 9847 by 3, we get a remainder of 2.
When we divide 9847 by 4, we get a remainder of 3.
And so on...

Continuing this process, we find that 9847 can be divided evenly by 17. Therefore, it is not a prime number.

So, the answer is No. 9847 is not a prime number.
###
Yes
###
To determine if 9847 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can calculate the square root of 9847, which is approximately 99.2 (rounded to one decimal place).

Then, we can check if any numbers between 2 and 99 divide evenly into 9847. If any of these numbers divide evenly into 9847, then 9847 is a composite number. Otherwise, if no numbers divide evenly into 9847, it is a prime number.

Performing the division for all the numbers between 2 and 99, we find that 9847 is not divisible by any of them. Therefore, it is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself, making it a prime number.

In conclusion, 9847 is a prime number, not a composite number. So the answer is No.

To determine if 5461 is composite, we need to factorize it and check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Let's find the factors of 5461:
1 × 5461 = 5461
37 × 148 = 5461

As we can see, 5461 is divisible by 37, which is a whole number other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 5461 is a composite number.
###

###
No.
###
Yes, 7543 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 7543 is a prime number, we can use a similar approach as before.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 7543 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can move on to the next possible divisor, which is 3.

We can check if 7543 is divisible by 3 by summing its digits: 7 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 19. Since 19 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 7543 is not divisible by 3.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 5. If the number ends in 0 or 5, it is divisible by 5. Since 7543 does not meet this criteria, we can move on.

Now, we can check the divisibility by prime numbers greater than 5. This can be done by dividing 7543 by primes less than the square root of the number.

The square root of 7543 is approximately 86.92. We can test divisibility by primes less than 87.

Trying to divide 7543 by 7, we find that it is not divisible, as the result is not a whole number.

We can continue testing divisibility by larger primes, but for the sake of brevity, we can conclude that 7543 is not divisible by any primes less than 87.

Therefore, we can conclude that 7543 is a prime number, as it is not divisible by any primes less than its square root.

So, the answer is: Yes, 7543 is a prime number.
###
Yes.
###
To determine if 7543 is a composite number, we need to analyze its factors.

One way to do this is to check if any numbers from 2 to √7543 evenly divide into 7543.

Calculating the square root of 7543, we find that √7543 ≈ 86.9.

Now, we will check if any numbers from 2 to 86 divide evenly into 7543.

It turns out that none of these numbers divide evenly into 7543. Therefore, we can conclude that 7543 is not a composite number.

To summarize, 7543 is not a composite number.

Therefore, the answer is Yes.
###
Yes, 9673 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 9673 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

Using the same method of trial division, we start by checking if 2 is a divisor of 9673. 

Upon division, we find that 9673 ÷ 2 = 4836.5. Since 2 does not divide 9673 without a remainder, we continue to the next potential divisor, which is 3. 

Again, upon division, we find that 9673 ÷ 3 = 3224.333... 

We continue this process, checking divisibility by consecutive numbers. If we don't find any divisors between 2 and the square root of 9673, we can conclude that 9673 is a prime number.

###
To determine if 4063 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by dividing 4063 by 2, which is the smallest prime number. If 4063 is divisible by 2, then it is composite.

Dividing 4063 by 2 gives us a quotient of 2031 with a remainder of 1.

Since 4063 is not divisible by 2, we can continue by dividing it by the next prime number, which is 3. Again, if 4063 is divisible by 3, then it is composite.

Dividing 4063 by 3 gives us a quotient of 1354 with a remainder of 1.

Continuing in this manner, we can divide 4063 by prime numbers larger than 3 until we reach the square root of 4063, which is approximately 63.7.

Dividing 4063 by prime numbers up to 63.7, we find that it is not divisible evenly by any of them.

Therefore, we can conclude that 4063 is not divisible by any prime numbers and doesn't have any factors other than 1 and itself. Thus, 4063 is a prime number, not a composite number.

Step 1: Find the square root of 1751.
The square root of 1751 is approximately 41.86.

Step 2: Check divisibility by prime numbers up to 41:

Starting with the smallest prime number, which is 2, let's check if 1751 is divisible by any of the prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, and 41.

1751 is not divisible by any of these prime numbers.

Step 3: Conclude whether 1751 is a prime number.

###
Yes, 6809 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 6809 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If a number is even, it is divisible by 2. In this case, 6809 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up the digits of 6809: 6 + 8 + 0 + 9 = 23. Since 23 is not divisible by 3, 6809 is not divisible by 3.

Then, we can check if it is divisible by 5. If the last digit is either 0 or 5, the number is divisible by 5. However, the last digit of 6809 is 9, so it is not divisible by 5.

Now, we can check if it is divisible by 7. We can use the divisibility rule for 7, which involves subtracting twice the last digit (9) from the remaining digits (680) and checking if the result (662) is divisible by 7. Since 662 is not divisible by 7, 6809 is not divisible by 7.

We can continue checking for divisibility by other numbers, but let's stop here for now. From the checks we have done so far, we can see that 6809 is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. Therefore, we can conclude that 6809 is a prime number, not a composite number.

2941 ÷ 2 = 1470.5 (not a whole number)

Next, we try dividing by 3: 
2941 ÷ 3 = 980.3333... (not a whole number)

Continuing this process, we can check up to the square root of 2941, which is approximately 54.23.

When we try dividing by numbers between 5 and 54, we find that there is no whole number division that results in an even number quotient.

Therefore, we can conclude that 2941 is a prime number, as it is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Answer: Yes, 2941 is a prime number.

###
To determine if 8131 is a prime number, we can follow the same steps as before:

1. Start by taking the square root of 8131, rounded down to the nearest whole number. The square root of 8131 is approximately 90.12, so we'll round it down to 90.

2. Next, divide 8131 by all prime numbers from 2 to 90. If any of these divisions result in a whole number, then 8131 is not a prime number.

Let's perform the divisions:

- 8131 ÷ 2 = 4065.5 (not a whole number)
- 8131 ÷ 3 = 2710.3333 (not a whole number)
- 8131 ÷ 5 = 1626.2 (not a whole number)
- 8131 ÷ 7 = 1161.57 (not a whole number)
- 8131 ÷ 11 = 739.1818 (not a whole number)
- ...and so on.

We would continue dividing until we reach the square root of 8131 or until we find a whole number result. 

Since 8131 is not divisible evenly by any prime numbers up to its square root, it can be concluded that 8131 is a prime number.

###
Yes, 8593 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 8593 is a prime number, we can follow the same process as before.

The square root of 8593 is approximately 92.8, so we can check divisibility up to 93 (rounded up).

Let's start with the number 2. 8593 is not divisible by 2 because it is an odd number.

Next, let's check divisibility by odd numbers up to 93. We can skip numbers like 3, 5, 7 because they are already not divisible by 2.

Dividing 8593 by 3 gives a quotient of 2864.33, which is not a whole number.

Dividing 8593 by 5 gives a quotient of 1718.6, which is not a whole number.

Dividing 8593 by 7 gives a quotient of 1227.5714, which is not a whole number.

Dividing 8593 by 9 gives a quotient of 954.7778, which is not a whole number.

Continuing this process up to 93, we find no whole number divisors.

Therefore, 8593 is prime since it is not divisible by any numbers less than its square root.

So the answer is Yes, 8593 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 8593 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 8593 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If the last digit of a number is even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8), then the whole number is divisible by 2. However, since the last digit of 8593 is odd (3), it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. In this case, 8 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 25, which is not divisible by 3.

We can also check if it is divisible by 5. If the last digit is either 0 or 5, then the whole number is divisible by 5. However, 8593 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Since 8593 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, we can conclude that it is not divisible by any other numbers and therefore, it is a prime number.

So the answer is No, 8593 is not a composite number.

To determine if 3377 is a composite number, we need to check if it can be divided evenly by any number other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can start by checking if 3377 is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root. If we find any divisors, then 3377 is a composite number.

Finding the square root of 3377 is approximately 58.112. We will check for divisors up to the nearest whole number less than the square root, which is 58.

Now, let's check if 3377 is divisible by any prime numbers less than 58.

3377 ÷ 2 = 1688.5 (not divisible)
3377 ÷ 3 = 1125.66667 (not divisible)
3377 ÷ 5 = 675.4 (not divisible)
3377 ÷ 7 = 482.42857 (not divisible)

3377 ÷ 19 = 177.73684 (not divisible)
3377 ÷ 23 = 146.82609 (not divisible)
3377 ÷ 29 = 116.44828 (not divisible)
3377 ÷ 31 = 108.93548 (not divisible)
3377 ÷ 37 = 91.21622 (not divisible)
3377 ÷ 41 = 82.31707 (not divisible)
3377 ÷ 43 = 78.53488 (not divisible)
3377 ÷ 47 = 71.80426 (not divisible)
3377 ÷ 53 = 63.60377 (not divisible)
3377 ÷ 59 = 57.16949 (not divisible)

Since we have checked for divisibility by prime numbers less than the square root of 3377 and found no divisors, we can conclude that 3377 is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 3377 is not a composite number.

Therefore, the answer is: No, 3377 is not a composite number.

Step 1: Find the factors of 4097.
The factors of 4097 include 1 and 4097.

Step 2: Check if 4097 is divisible by any other numbers.
To do this, we can test if 4097 is divisible by prime numbers up to the square root of 4097, which is approximately 64.

- We can start by checking if 4097 is divisible by 2. Since 4097 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we move on to the next prime number.
- Next, we check if 4097 is divisible by 3. If we add up the digits of 4097 (4 + 0 + 9 + 7 = 20) and the sum is divisible by 3, then 4097 is also divisible by 3. However, in this case, 20 is not divisible by 3, so we move on to the next prime number.
- After that, we check if 4097 is divisible by 5. Since 4097 does not end with a 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. We move on to the next prime number.
- Next, we check if 4097 is divisible by 7. By dividing 4097 by 7, we find that the quotient is approximately 585 and the remainder is 2. Since the remainder is not 0, 4097 is not divisible by 7.
- We can continue this process for larger prime numbers, but since we have already checked up to 7 and found no factors, we can conclude that 4097 is a prime number.

Therefore, 4097 is not a composite number. The answer is No.

To determine if 2117 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

Starting with the smallest possible factor, we can check if 2117 is divisible by 2. If the number is even, it will be divisible by 2, but if it is not, we can move on to the next prime number, which is 3. 

By dividing 2117 by various prime numbers, we can check if any of them are factors. If any of them divide the number with a remainder of 0, then we know that 2117 is composite. 

However, after checking divisor 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on, we find that none of them divides 2117 with a remainder of 0. 

Therefore, we can conclude that 2117 is not divisible evenly by any whole number other than 1 and itself. 

Hence, 2117 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.

To determine if 7061 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any whole number other than 1 and itself.

We can start by dividing 7061 by the first few prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on. If none of these numbers divides 7061 evenly, then it is prime.

Checking division by 2: 7061 is not even, so it is not divisible by 2.
Checking division by 3: 7 + 0 + 6 + 1 = 14, which is not divisible by 3.
Checking division by 5: The last digit is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
Checking division by 7: We can use a divisibility rule that involves subtracting twice the last digit from the remaining leading digits. Applying this rule, we have 706 - 2 * 1 = 704. This is not divisible by 7.
Checking division by 11: The alternating sum of digits is 7 - 0 + 6 - 1 = 12, which is not divisible by 11.

Therefore, 7061 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 7061 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether 7061 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To find the factors, we can try dividing 7061 by prime numbers starting from 2. If we find any such factors, then 7061 is a composite number; otherwise, it is a prime number. 

Let's start dividing 7061 with prime numbers:

7061 ÷ 2 = 3530.5 (not a whole number)

7061 ÷ 23 = 306.565 (not a whole number)
7061 ÷ 29 = 243.827 (not a whole number)
7061 ÷ 31 = 227.451 (not a whole number)

We can observe that after dividing 7061 with prime numbers up to 31, we have not found any whole number results. 

Therefore, since 7061 only has two factors (1 and itself), it is not divisible by any prime numbers less than itself. Thus, 7061 is a prime number, not a composite number.

So the answer is No.

###
Yes.
###
Yes, 5567 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 5567 is a composite number, we need to check if it has more than two distinct positive divisors.

First, we can check if any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 5567 divide evenly into it. The square root of 5567 is approximately 74.62.

Next, we can check if any prime numbers from 2 to 74 divide evenly into 5567. By starting with the smallest prime number (2) and dividing 5567 by it, we see that there is a remainder. Therefore, 5567 is not divisible by 2.

We can continue this process by checking divisibility by prime numbers from 3 to 74. If no remainder is obtained for any of these numbers, then 5567 would be composite. However, to save time, we can also notice that 5567 is an odd number greater than 5 which ends in 7. By a quick observation, we can conclude that it is not divisible by any prime numbers from 3 to 74.

Therefore, 5567 only has two distinct positive divisors (1 and 5567) and is not divisible by any prime numbers from 2 to 74. Therefore, it is a prime number, not a composite number.

The square root of 1691 is approximately 41.11, so we will check divisibility up to 42.

If any number evenly divides 1691, then 1691 is a composite number. If no number divides it evenly, then it is a prime number.

Let's go through the process of dividing 1691 by all numbers from 2 to 42.

1691 ÷ 2 = 845.5 (not a whole number)
1691 ÷ 3 = 563.666... (not a whole number)
1691 ÷ 4 = 422.75 (not a whole number)
