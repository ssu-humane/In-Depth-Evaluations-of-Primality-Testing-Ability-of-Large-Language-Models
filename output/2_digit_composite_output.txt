###
To determine if 55 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if 55 is divisible evenly by 2. Since it is not divisible by 2, we can continue checking for divisibility by the next odd numbers: 3, 5, 7, and so on.

When checking for divisibility by 3, we can sum the digits of 55: 5 + 5 = 10. Since 10 is divisible by 3, we know that 55 is also divisible by 3.

Therefore, 55 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 3.
###
No, 55 is not a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself. However, 55 only has divisors of 1, 5, 11, and 55, so it is not composite.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it can be divided by any number other than 1 and itself.

Next, we check if 56 is divisible by 3. Adding the digits of 56 (5 + 6 = 11), we see that 11 is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 56 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue checking other prime numbers, but we can already conclude that 56 is not a prime number because it has divisors other than 1 and itself (2 and 28).

So, in conclusion, 56 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 56 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 56 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: We know that 1 is a factor of every number, so let's check if there are any other factors of 56.

Step 2: Divide 56 by each number starting from 2 and going up to the square root of 56 (approximately 7.48).

When we divide 56 by 2, we get 28.
When we divide 56 by 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, we don't get a whole number.

Step 3: Since 56 has factors of 2 and 28, it is a composite number.

Therefore, the answer is yes, 56 is a composite number.

No, 57 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 3 (57 = 3 x 19).
###
To determine if 57 is a prime number, we need to find if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Start by checking if 57 is divisible by 2. Since 57 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Step 2: Next, check if 57 is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root, which is approximately 7.55. Check for divisibility by 3, 5, and 7.

- Dividing 57 by 3 gives a quotient of 19 with a remainder of 0. So, 57 is divisible by 3.
- Dividing 57 by 5 gives a quotient of 11 with a remainder of 2. So, 57 is not divisible by 5.
- Dividing 57 by 7 gives a quotient of 8 with a remainder of 1. So, 57 is not divisible by 7.

Step 3: Since 57 has divisors other than 1 and itself (3 and 19), it is not a prime number.

Therefore, 57 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 57 is a composite number. It can be evenly divided by 1, 3, 19, and 57.
###
To determine if 57 is a composite number, we need to factorize it into its prime factors. We can start by dividing it by small prime numbers.

Dividing 57 by 2 gives us a remainder of 1, so it is not divisible by 2.
Dividing 57 by 3 gives us a quotient of 19, which is a prime number.

Since 57 can be divided by 3 and 19 without any remainders, it can be expressed as the product of these two prime numbers: 57 = 3 × 19.

Since 57 has more than two distinct positive factors (1, 3, 19, and 57), it is a composite number.

###
No, 58 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2 and 29.
###
To determine whether 58 is a prime number, let's consider its factors. 

We start by checking if 2 is a factor of 58. Since 2 does not divide 58 evenly (58 ÷ 2 = 29), 2 is not a factor of 58. 

Next, we check if 3 is a factor of 58. Again, 3 does not divide 58 evenly (58 ÷ 3 = 19 remainder 1), so 3 is not a factor of 58.

We continue this process up to the square root of 58, which is approximately 7.6. 

Checking if 4 is a factor of 58, we find that it is not (58 ÷ 4 = 14 remainder 2).
Checking if 5 is a factor of 58, we find that it is not (58 ÷ 5 = 11 remainder 3).
Checking if 6 is a factor of 58, we find that it is not (58 ÷ 6 = 9 remainder 4).
Checking if 7 is a factor of 58, we find that it is not (58 ÷ 7 = 8 remainder 2).

Since there are no factors other than itself and 1, we can conclude that 58 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 58 is a composite number.
###
Yes, 58 is a composite number. 

To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself.

For number 65, we can start by dividing it by 2, which is the smallest prime number. Since 65 is not divisible evenly by 2 (as 65/2 = 32.5 which is not a whole number), we can conclude that 65 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can try dividing 65 by 3. Again, 65 is not divisible evenly by 3 (as 65/3 = 21.6666... which is not a whole number).

With this process, we continue checking divisibility up to the square root of 65 (approximately 8.06). Checking divisibility by numbers beyond this point is not necessary since any factors of 65 must be smaller than its square root.

Continuing this method, we find that 65 is divisible by 5, as 65/5 = 13 (which is a whole number). Therefore, 65 is not a prime number.

To summarize, 65 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 5.
###
No, 65 is not a composite number because it is only divisible by 1 and itself.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

In the case of 65, we can see that it is divisible evenly by 5 and 13, in addition to 1 and 65. Therefore, 65 has factors other than 1 and itself, making it a composite number.

86 ÷ 2 = 43, not divisible
86 ÷ 3 = 28.67, not divisible
86 ÷ 5 = 17.2, not divisible
86 ÷ 7 = 12.29, not divisible

Since 86 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root, we can say that 86 is not divisible by any other numbers except 1 and itself. Therefore, 86 is a prime number.
###
No, 86 is not a composite number. It is an even number that is divisible by 2 and 43.
###
To determine if 86 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can try dividing 86 by prime numbers from 2 until the square root of 86 (which is approximately 9.3). 

If any of these prime numbers divide 86 without leaving a remainder, then 86 is composite. If none of the prime numbers divide 86 without leaving a remainder, then 86 is a prime number.

Let's check:

86 ÷ 2 = 43 (no remainder)
86 ÷ 3 = 28 remainder 2
86 ÷ 4 = 21 remainder 2
86 ÷ 5 = 17 remainder 1
86 ÷ 6 = 14 remainder 2
86 ÷ 7 = 12 remainder 2
86 ÷ 8 = 10 remainder 6

3 * 29 = 87

Since 87 can be divided evenly by 1, 3, 29, and 87, it is not a prime number.
###
No, 87 is not a composite number.
###
To determine if 87 is a composite number, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself.

Let's find the factors of 87:

###
No, 88 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2, 4, 8, 11, 22, 44, and 88.
###
To determine if 88 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

Step 1: Start by checking if 2 is a factor of 88. Since 88 is an even number and divisible by 2, we can divide it by 2 to get 88/2 = 44. 

Step 2: Next, check if 44 is divisible by 2. Again, since 44 is even, we can divide it by 2 to get 44/2 = 22. 

Step 3: Now, check if 22 is divisible by 2. Similar to the previous steps, we divide it by 2 to get 22/2 = 11. 

Step 4: Finally, check if 11 is divisible by any numbers from 2 up to the square root of 11 (which is approximately 3.3). 

Since 11 is a prime number and does not have any factors other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that 88 is not a prime number. It can be expressed as a product of prime factors: 88 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 11.
###
Yes, 88 is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has factors other than 1 and itself. In the case of 88, it can be expressed as the product of two positive integers: 2 and 44, or 4 and 22. Therefore, 88 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 88 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2, since it ends in an even number. If we divide 88 by 2, we get 44. Therefore, 2 is a factor of 88.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. Adding the digits of 88, we get 8 + 8 = 16. Since 16 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 88 is not divisible by 3.

We can also check if it is divisible by 4. If the last two digits of 88,  are divisible by 4, then 88 is also divisible by 4. In this case, 88 is divisible by 4 since 88 ÷ 4 = 22.

Now, let's check if 88 is divisible by 5. Since it does not end in 5 or 0, it is not divisible by 5.

Similarly, we can check if it is divisible by numbers 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and so on. However, since 88 is already divisible by 2 and 4, it cannot be divisible by any other number greater than 4.

Therefore, the factors of 88 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 11, 22, 44, and 88.

Since 88 has factors other than 1 and itself, it is a composite number.

No, 90 is not a prime number. It is divisible by other numbers such as 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, and 90.
###
To determine if 90 is a prime number, we need to understand what a prime number is. 

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. 

To test if 90 is prime, we can check if it is divisible by any natural numbers greater than 1 and less than itself. 

Let's go through the divisibility tests:

1. Divisible by 2: 90 is divisible by 2 because it is an even number.

2. Divisible by 3: To determine if it is divisible by 3, we add the digits of 90: 9+0=9. Since 9 is divisible by 3, 90 is also divisible by 3.

Since we found two factors of 90 (2 and 3) other than 1 and 90 itself, we can conclude that 90 is not a prime number.
###
No, 90 is not a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has at least one divisor other than 1 and itself. 90 can be divided evenly by 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, and 90, so it is a composite number.
###
A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has at least one factor other than 1 and itself. 

To determine if 90 is a composite number, we need to check if there are any factors of 90 other than 1 and 90.

The factors of 90 are:
1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90.

Since 90 has multiple factors other than 1 and 90, it is indeed a composite number.

###
Yes.
###
No, 91 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 7 and 13, in addition to 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 91 is a prime number, we can check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we know that 91 is divisible by 1. 
Now, let's check if it is divisible by any other number. We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. Since 2 does not evenly divide into 91 (91 ÷ 2 = 45 remainder 1), we can conclude that 91 is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we sum the digits of 91 which is 9 + 1 = 10, and if 10 is divisible by 3, then 91 is also divisible by 3. However, 10 is not divisible by 3, so we can conclude that 91 is not divisible by 3.

Since we have checked divisibility by 2 and 3, two of the divisors of 91, and found that it is not evenly divisible by either, we can conclude that 91 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 91 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 91 is a composite number, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. To do this, we can try dividing 91 by numbers starting from 2 and up to its square root, which is approximately 9.54. 

If any of these numbers evenly divide 91, then 91 is composite. Otherwise, if none of them divide 91 evenly, then 91 is a prime number. Let's try dividing 91 by numbers.

If we try dividing 91 by 2, we get a remainder of 1 (91 ÷ 2 = 45 R1).
If we try dividing 91 by 3, we get a remainder of 1 (91 ÷ 3 = 30 R1).
If we try dividing 91 by 4, we get a remainder of 3 (91 ÷ 4 = 22 R3).
If we try dividing 91 by 5, we get a remainder of 1 (91 ÷ 5 = 18 R1).
If we try dividing 91 by 6, we get a remainder of 1 (91 ÷ 6 = 15 R1).
If we try dividing 91 by 7, we get a remainder of 0 (91 ÷ 7 = 13 R0).

Since 91 is divisible by numbers other than 1 and itself (specifically, it is divisible by 7), we can conclude that 91 is a composite number.
###

###
Yes.
###
No, 92 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2 and 46.
###
To determine whether 92 is a prime number, we will check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we check if 92 is divisible evenly by 2. 92 divided by 2 equals 46, with no remainder.

Next, we check if 46 is divisible evenly by 2. 46 divided by 2 equals 23, with no remainder.

Since there are no other factors of 92, other than 1 and 92 itself, we can conclude that 92 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2 and 46.

Therefore, 92 is a composite number.
###
No, 92 is not a composite number.
###
To determine whether 92 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by numbers other than 1 and itself.

First, we can see that 92 is divisible by 2 since it ends with an even digit. Dividing 92 by 2, we get 46.

Next, we can check if 92 is divisible by any number greater than 2 and less than or equal to its square root (√92 ≈ 9.59). Trying numbers 3 to 9, we see that 92 is not evenly divisible by any of these numbers.

Since 92 is divisible by 2 but not by any other numbers less than √92, it is not a composite number. Instead, 92 is considered an even, non-composite number.
###
No.
###
Yes.
###
No, 93 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3, 31, and 93.
###
To determine if 93 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

We can start by checking if 93 is divisible by 2. Since 93 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can move on to the next potential divisor.

Next, we check if 93 is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 93 is 9 + 3 = 12, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 93 is divisible by 3.

Since 93 is divisible by a number other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.
###
No, 93 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
###
To determine if 93 is a composite number, we must check if it can be divided evenly by any whole numbers other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can start dividing 93 by numbers starting from 2 up to the square root of 93, which is approximately 9.64.

If any of these numbers divide 93 evenly, then 93 is a composite number. Otherwise, it is a prime number.

Let's proceed with the division:

93 ÷ 2 = 46.5 (not an exact division)
93 ÷ 3 = 31 (an exact division)

As we can see, 93 can be divided evenly by 3, which means that it is a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
No.
###
No, 94 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2 and 47, in addition to 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 94 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

Step 1: Find the factors of 94:
The factors of 94 are: 1, 2, 47, 94.

Step 2: Check if 94 has any factors other than 1 and itself:
Since 94 has factors other than 1 and itself, namely, 2 and 47, it is not a prime number.

Therefore, 94 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 94 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 94 is a composite number, we need to check if it can be divided evenly by any integer other than 1 and itself.

We start by checking if 94 is divisible by 2. Since it ends in an even digit (4), it is indeed divisible by 2. Dividing 94 by 2 gives us 47.

Next, we check if 94 is divisible by 3. If the sum of its digits is divisible by 3, then 94 is also divisible by 3. However, 9 + 4 = 13, which is not divisible by 3.

Checking further, we can skip checking for divisibility by 4 and continue to check for divisibility by 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. None of these numbers divide 94 evenly.

Therefore, 94 is not divisible by any number other than itself and 1. Therefore, it is not a composite number, but a prime number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes, 94 is divisible by 47.
###
No, 95 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 1, 5, 19, and 95.
###
To determine if 95 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by dividing it by 2. If 95 is divisible by 2, then it is not a prime number. However, 95 is not divisible by 2 as 95 ÷ 2 = 47.5, which is not a whole number.

Next, we can try dividing it by various numbers up to the square root of 95. This is because if there is a number greater than the square root that divides evenly into 95, then there must also be a corresponding factor less than the square root.

When we divide 95 by 3, we get 95 ÷ 3 = 31.67, which is not a whole number.

We can continue this process with other prime numbers like 5, 7, 11, etc., until we reach the square root of 95, which is approximately 9.74. 

However, we can already gather that 95 is not divisible by any of these prime numbers, which means that 95 is a prime number.

Therefore, 95 is indeed a prime number.
###
No, 95 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
###
To determine whether 95 is a composite number, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if 2 is a factor of 95. Since 2 does not evenly divide 95, we move on to the next possible factor.

Next, we check if 3 is a factor of 95. Again, 95 is not divisible by 3.

Then, we check if 4 is a factor of 95. Since 4 is greater than the square root of 95 (approximately 9.7), we don't need to check any further.

Continuing this process, we check if 5 is a factor of 95. We find that 95 is divisible by 5, as 5 multiplied by 19 equals 95.

Therefore, since 95 has factors other than 1 and itself (5 and 19), it is a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes.
###
No, 96 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, and 96.
###
To determine if 96 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any whole number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 96 is an even number, it is divisible by 2. We can write 96 as 2 * 48.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 96 is 9 + 6 = 15, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 96 is also divisible by 3. We can write 96 as 3 * 32.

So, 96 can be written as the product of the primes 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, and 3.

Therefore, 96 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 96 is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has more than two positive divisors. In the case of 96, it can be divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, and 96, making it a composite number.
###
To determine if 96 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors apart from 1 and itself. 

We can start by finding the factors of 96. 

96 divided by 2 equals 48. 
48 divided by 2 equals 24.
24 divided by 2 equals 12.
12 divided by 2 equals 6.
6 divided by 2 equals 3.

Since 96 has a factor of 2, it is a composite number.
###
Yes. 96 is divisible by 32.
###
Yes.
###
No, 98 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2 and 7, among other factors.
###
To determine if 98 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Starting with 2, we can see that 98 is divisible by 2 since 98 ÷ 2 = 49. Therefore, 98 is not a prime number because it has divisors other than 1 and itself.

So, 98 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 98 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 98 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking if 2 is a factor of 98. If 2 divides evenly into 98, then 98 is composite. 

98 ÷ 2 = 49

Since 2 is a factor of 98, we know it is composite. 

Therefore, 98 is a composite number.
###
Yes. 98 is divisible by 14.
###
No.
###
No, 99 is not a prime number. It can be evenly divided by 1, 3, 9, 11, 33, and 99. Therefore, it is a composite number.
###
To determine if 99 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

First, we observe that 99 is divisible by 3 since the sum of its digits (9+9=18) is divisible by 3. 

Therefore, 99 is not a prime number because it has divisors other than 1 and itself.
###
No, 99 is not a composite number. It is a composite number if it can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 and itself. However, 99 can only be divided evenly by 1 and 99.
###
To determine if 99 is a composite number, we need to analyze its factors. A composite number is defined as any positive integer greater than 1 that can be divided evenly (without leaving a remainder) by at least one positive integer other than itself and 1.

The factors of 99 are: 1, 3, 9, 11, 33, and 99.

Since 99 has factors other than 1 and itself, namely 3, 9, 11, 33, it is indeed a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
No.
