###
No, 8485 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 8485 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

First, we find the square root of 8485:
√8485 ≈ 92.085

Now, let's check if 8485 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 92.

Divisibility by 2: 8485 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.
Divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of 8485 is 8 + 4 + 8 + 5 = 25, which is not divisible by 3.
Divisibility by 5: 8485 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Now, we can check divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 8485:

Divisibility by 7: 8485 divided by 7 is approximately 1212.143, which is not an integer.

Therefore, 8485 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root. Thus, we can conclude that 8485 is a prime number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it can be divided by any other numbers besides 1 and itself. Let's check the divisibility of 8485 by numbers other than 1 and itself.

8485 is divisible by 5 because the last digit is 5.
To check the divisibility by 5, we can add the digits and check if the sum is divisible by 5.
8 + 4 + 8 + 5 = 25
Since 25 is divisible by 5, 8485 is also divisible by 5.

Since 8485 is divisible by 5, it is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

In the case of 8485, we can start checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers starting from 2. If we find a factor, then 8485 is a composite number; otherwise, it is prime. 

First, let's divide 8485 by 2: 

8485 ÷ 2 = 4242 remainder 1 

Since we have a remainder, 2 is not a factor of 8485. 

Next, let's divide 8485 by 3: 

8485 ÷ 3 = 2828 remainder 1 

Again, we have a remainder, so 3 is not a factor. 

We can continue this process with other prime numbers, but let's skip to 7 for convenience. 

If we divide 8485 by 7: 

8485 ÷ 7 = 1212 remainder 1 

Once again, we have a remainder. 

Since we haven't found a prime factor yet, we need to check larger primes. The next prime to test would be 11. 

If we divide 8485 by 11: 

8485 ÷ 11 = 771 remainder 4 

Still, we have a remainder. 

We can go on with this process, but at this point, we can conclude that 8485 doesn't have any prime factors except for 1 and itself. 

Therefore, 8485 is a prime number, not a composite number.

###
Yes.
###
No, 5354 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 5354 is a prime number, we can proceed as follows:

1. Check divisibility by even numbers: Any number ending in an even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8) is divisible by 2. Since 5354 does end in an even digit, it is divisible by 2, and therefore not a prime number.

Therefore, 5354 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 5354 is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has more than two distinct positive divisors.
###
Yes, 5354 is a composite number. 

To determine if a number is composite, we first need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. 

In the case of 5354, we can divide it by 2, and we get 2677. 

Next, we can divide it by 3, but it is not divisible evenly. 

Further, we can continue checking divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 5354 (approximately 73.2). However, it is not necessary in this case because we have already found a factor of 2.

Therefore, 5354 is a composite number.
###

###
Yes.
###
Yes, 4151 is a prime number.
###
To determine whether 4151 is a prime number, we can use a few different methods. One common method is to check if the number is divisible by any prime number less than or equal to its square root.

First, we find the square root of 4151 which is approximately 64.39. Now, we check if 4151 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 64:

2: 4151 is not divisible by 2 because it is odd.
3: The sum of the digits of 4151 is 4 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 11, which is not divisible by 3.

31: 4151 is not divisible by 31.
37: The sum of the three-digit substrings formed from consecutive digits of 4151 is 41 + 15 + 51 = 107, which is not divisible by 37.
41: 4151 is not divisible by 41.
43: 4151 is not divisible by 43.
47: 4151 is not divisible by 47.
53: 4151 is not divisible by 53.
59: 4151 is not divisible by 59.
61: 4151 is not divisible by 61.

Since we have checked all prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 4151 and found that it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 4151 is a prime number.

Therefore, yes, 4151 is a prime number.
###
No, 4151 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it can be divided by any number other than 1 and itself.

So, to check if 4151 is composite, we will test if it can be divided by any numbers other than 1 and 4151.

Starting with the number 2, we can see that 4151 is not divisible by 2, as there is no remainder when dividing.

Checking with 3, we get a result that 4151 is not divisible by 3.

Continuing this process, we can test divisibility by other numbers until the square root of 4151 is reached.

Calculating the square root of 4151, we find that it is approximately 64.40.

Checking divisibility up to 64, we find that 4151 is not divisible by any of those numbers, including odd and even numbers.

Therefore, after testing all possible divisors, we can conclude that 4151 is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

Hence, the number 4151 is not a composite number but rather a prime number.

No, 3273 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3 and 1081.
###
To determine if 3273 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 3273 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.
Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (3 + 2 + 7 + 3) is 15, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 3273 is divisible by 3.
Hence, 3273 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 3.
###
Yes, 3273 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 3273 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we need to find the factors of 3273. The factors of a number are the numbers that divide evenly into it.

Let's check the divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 3273, which is approximately 57.15.

- 3273 is not divisible by 2 because it is an odd number.
- 3273 is not divisible by 3 since the sum of its digits (3 + 2 + 7 + 3) is not divisible by 3.
- 3273 is not divisible by 5 because it does not end with 0 or 5.
- 3273 is not divisible by 7 since 7 does not divide into 3273 without a remainder.
- 3273 is not divisible by 11 because the difference between the sum of its odd-positioned digits (3 + 7) and the sum of its even-positioned digits (2 + 3) is not divisible by 11.
- 3273 is not divisible by 13 after checking manually.

Since we have checked all prime numbers up to the square root of 3273 and found no divisors, we can conclude that 3273 is a prime number.

###
Yes.
###
No, 5818 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2, 7, 11, 17, 19, 23, and other numbers.
###
To determine if 5818 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If a number is even and not equal to 2, it is not prime because it has 2 as a factor. 5818 is even, so it is divisible by 2.

5818 divided by 2 is 2909. Since 2909 is an odd number, we can check for divisibility by odd numbers starting from 3. 

Next, we can check for divisibility by 3. 5+8+1+8=22, and 22 is not divisible by 3, so 5818 is also not divisible by 3.

Since 5818 is not divisible by 2 or 3, we can continue checking for divisibility by odd numbers up to √5818, which is approximately 76.

Checking for divisibility by 5, we see that the last digit of 5818 is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Checking divisibility by 7, we can use the divisibility rule which states that we can subtract twice the units digit from the rest of the number. The result, 581 - (2*8) = 581 - 16 = 565, is not divisible by 7, so 5818 is not divisible by 7.

We can continue in this manner, checking divisibility by 11, 13, 17, 19, etc., but we can observe that 5818 is divisible by 2. Therefore, it is not a prime number.

So, to answer your question, 5818 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 5818 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to factorize it.
Let's try to find the factors of 5818.
The factors of 5818 are 1, 2, 43, 67, 86, 134, 286, 335, 871, 1670, 1742, and 2909.
Since 5818 has more than two factors, it is a composite number.
###
Yes, 5818 is divisible by 2.
###
Yes.
###
No, 1195 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 5 and 239.
###
To check if a number is prime, we first need to divide it by all numbers less than it. If any of these divisions result in an integer quotient, then the number is not prime.

Let's divide 1195 by all numbers less than it:

1195 ÷ 2 = 597.5 (not an integer quotient)
1195 ÷ 3 = 398.33333... (not an integer quotient)
1195 ÷ 4 = 298.75 (not an integer quotient)
1195 ÷ 5 = 239 (integer quotient)
1195 ÷ 6 = 199.16666... (not an integer quotient)
1195 ÷ 7 = 170.71428... (not an integer quotient)
1195 ÷ 8 = 149.375 (not an integer quotient)
1195 ÷ 9 = 132.77777... (not an integer quotient)
1195 ÷ 10 = 119.5 (not an integer quotient)

So, we can see that 1195 is divisible by 5. Hence, 1195 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 1195 is a composite number. It has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 1195 is a composite number, we can check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can start by dividing 1195 by prime numbers starting from 2. If we find any divisor, then 1195 is a composite number. If we reach the square root of 1195 without finding any divisor, then it is a prime number.

Let's try dividing 1195 by 2. We find that 2 does not divide evenly into 1195.

Next, let's try dividing it by 3. Again, 3 does not divide evenly into 1195.

Continuing this process, let's try with 5. Dividing 1195 by 5 gives us a quotient of 239, which is a positive integer.

Since we found a divisor (5) for 1195 other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that 1195 is a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes
###
No, 4835 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

Let's start by checking if 4835 is divisible by 2. If a number is even, it is always divisible by 2. In this case, since 4835 ends with an odd digit (5), it is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check divisibility by 3. To do this, we add up the individual digits of 4835 and see if the sum is divisible by 3. In this case, 4 + 8 + 3 + 5 = 20, and 20 is not divisible by 3.

Now, let's check divisibility by 5. If a number ends with 0 or 5, it is divisible by 5. Since 4835 does not end with 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Lastly, let's check divisibility by 7. This can be a bit more time-consuming, but we can use a trick known as the "divisibility rule of 7". We remove the last digit (5) and double it (5 * 2 = 10). Then, we subtract this doubled digit from the remaining digits (483 - 10 = 473). If the resulting number (473) is divisible by 7, then the original number (4835) is also divisible by 7. Otherwise, it is not. 

Let's apply this rule to the remaining digits of 483 (not 4835) to determine if 4835 is divisible by 7: 
47 - 2 * 3 = 47 - 6 = 41.

Since 41 is not divisible by 7, 4835 is not divisible by 7.

From the above checks, we conclude that 4835 is NOT divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 4835 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 4835 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.
For the number 4835, we can start by finding its prime factors:
Dividing by 2: 4835 ÷ 2 = 2417.5 (not a whole number)
Dividing by 3: 4835 ÷ 3 = 1611.666 (not a whole number)
Dividing by 4: 4835 ÷ 4 = 1208.75 (not a whole number)
Dividing by 5: 4835 ÷ 5 = 967 (not a whole number)
Dividing by 6: 4835 ÷ 6 = 805.833 (not a whole number)
Dividing by 7: 4835 ÷ 7 = 691.857 (not a whole number)
Dividing by 8: 4835 ÷ 8 = 604.375 (not a whole number)
Dividing by 9: 4835 ÷ 9 = 537.222 (not a whole number)
Dividing by 10: 4835 ÷ 10 = 483.5 (not a whole number)

Since we haven't found any factors other than 1 and 4835 itself, we can conclude that 4835 is a prime number and not composite.
###
Yes, 4835 is divisible by 5.
###
Yes.
###
No, 5739 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

We can start by checking if 5739 is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is not prime.
###
Yes, 5739 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 5739 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can find the prime factorization of 5739 by dividing it by prime numbers.

First, we divide by the smallest prime number, which is 2. But 5739 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we divide by 3. By performing the division, we find that 5739 divided by 3 is equal to 1913, with no remainder.

Now, let's check if 1913 is divisible by any prime number greater than 3. By trying prime numbers such as 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on, we find that 1913 is not divisible by any of them.

Since we cannot find any further prime factorization for 5739, we can conclude that it is a prime number.

Therefore, 5739 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
###
Yes, 5739 is divisible by 3.
###
Yes
###
No, 3849 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 3, 7, 19, and 59.
###
To determine if 3849 is a prime number, we can use the divisibility test.

First, we know that all prime numbers greater than 2 are odd. So, if 3849 is divisible by 2, then it is not a prime number.

To check for divisibility by 2, we look at the units digit. In this case, the units digit of 3849 is 9, which is odd. Therefore, 3849 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if 3849 is divisible by any odd numbers up to the square root of 3849, which is approximately 62.

We start by checking divisibility by 3. We add up the digits of 3849: 3 + 8 + 4 + 9 = 24. Since 24 is divisible by 3, we know that 3849 is also divisible by 3.

Therefore, 3849 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 3.
###
No, 3849 is not a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

Let's try to find the factors of 3849. We can start by dividing 3849 by 2:

3849 ÷ 2 = 1924 remainder 1

Since 2 does not divide evenly into 3849, let's try the next number, 3:

3849 ÷ 3 = 1283 remainder 0

We can see that 3 divides evenly into 3849. 

Therefore, 3849 has at least one factor other than 1 and itself, making it a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes.
###
Yes, 3891 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3.
###
To determine if 3891 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2. 
3891 is not even, so it is not divisible by 2.

Step 2: Check divisibility by odd numbers up to the square root of 3891. 
The square root of 3891 is approximately 62.39. We need to check divisibility by odd numbers up to 62.

3891 is not divisible by 3 (3 + 8 + 9 + 1 = 21, not divisible by 3).

Step 3: Continue checking divisibility by odd numbers.
3891 is not divisible by 5 (last digit is not 0 or 5).

Step 4: Check divisibility by 7. 
To check divisibility by 7, we can use the divisibility rule. Subtract twice the last digit (2 * 1 = 2) from the remaining truncated number (389 - 2 = 387), which results in 387. Repeating this process, we have 38 - 2 = 36, which is divisible by 7. 

Therefore, 3891 is divisible by 7.

Since 3891 is divisible by 7, it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 3891 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 3891 is a composite number, we need to check if it can be divided evenly by any number other than 1 and itself.

Let's start by finding the square root of 3891. The square root of 3891 is approximately 62.41.

Now, we'll check if 3891 is divisible by any number from 2 to 62. Since 3891 is an odd number, we can skip even numbers as they cannot be factors.

Let's begin checking: 
3891 ÷ 3 = 1297

Since 1297 is a prime number, there are no other factors between 3 and 62. Therefore, 3891 is a prime number, not a composite number.

So, the answer is no, 3891 is not a composite number.
###
Yes, 3891 is divisible by 3.
###
Yes.
###
Yes, 4143 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 4143 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 4143 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can move on to checking divisibility by odd numbers.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3 by summing its digits: 4 + 1 + 4 + 3 = 12. Since 12 is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 4143 is divisible by 3.

Therefore, 4143 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 3.
###
Yes, 4143 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 4143 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. To do that, we can start finding the factors of 4143 by dividing it by various numbers.

First, we'll test if it's divisible by 2. 4143 is an odd number, so it's not divisible by 2.

Next, we'll test if it's divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 4143 is 4 + 1 + 4 + 3 = 12, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 4143 is divisible by 3.

We divide 4143 by 3, which gives us 4143 ÷ 3 = 1381. 

1381 is not divisible by 2 or 3. 

Now, we'll continue trying to divide it by larger prime numbers. 

We find it is not divisible by 5, 7, 11, or 13.

Next, we check if it's divisible by 17. 4143 ÷ 17 = 243. 

243 is divisible by 3, specifically 243 ÷ 3 = 81.

81 is also divisible by 3, 81 ÷ 3 = 27.

27 is divisible by 3, 27 ÷ 3 = 9.

9 is divisible by 3, 9 ÷ 3 = 3.

Finally, we reach 3, which is prime and cannot be divided any further.

Since 4143 can be divided by 3 multiple times before reaching a prime number, we can conclude that 4143 is a composite number.

Therefore, the answer is yes, 4143 is a composite number.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any odd numbers up to its square root, which is approximately 34.14.

Let's start with 3. 1165 divided by 3 is approximately 388.33, which is not a whole number. So, 1165 is not divisible by 3.

Next, we check 1165 divided by 5, which is approximately 233. It is not a whole number either.

We can continue this process with other odd numbers such as 7, 11, 13, and so on, up to the square root of 1165.

If we are unable to find any factors other than 1 and itself, then 1165 is a prime number.

In this case, 1165 is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 1165 is a prime number.

No, 9634 is not a prime number. It can be evenly divided by 2, 3, 7, and 19.
###
To determine if 9634 is a prime number, we can use the method of trial division.

First, we check if 9634 is divisible by 2. If it is divisible by 2, then it is not a prime number. However, 9634 is an even number, so we can divide it by 2:

9634 ÷ 2 = 4817

Since 9634 divided by 2 equals 4817, which is not a whole number, we continue checking for divisibility by dividing it by all the prime numbers less than the square root of 9634.

Next, we check if 9634 is divisible by 3. Adding up the digits of 9634, we get:

9 + 6 + 3 + 4 = 22

Since 22 is not divisible by 3, 9634 is not divisible by 3. We continue with other prime numbers:

- 5: 9634 is not divisible by 5.
- 7: 9634 ÷ 7 = 1376
- 11: 9634 ÷ 11 = 876.7272727...

Therefore, 9634 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, or 11. We continue checking for divisibility by prime numbers up until the square root of 9634.

Prime numbers less than the square root of 9634:
- √9634 ≈ 98.15

We find that 9634 is prime if it is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 98. However, we have already checked all primes up until 11, so we can conclude that 9634 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 9634 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can start by checking if 9634 is divisible by prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 9634.

The square root of 9634 is approximately 98.15, so we only need to check divisibility by prime numbers up to 98.

Starting with the lowest prime number, which is 2, we can see that 9634 is not divisible by 2 as it is an odd number.

Next, we check divisibility by 3. The sum of its digits, 9 + 6 + 3 + 4, is equal to 22, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 9634 is not divisible by 3.

We continue checking divisibility by prime numbers up to 98, but since 9634 is not divisible by 2 or 3, it is highly unlikely to be divisible by any other prime numbers less than 98.

Therefore, we can conclude that 9634 is a composite number, as it is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 9634.

No, 8185 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 5 and 163, so it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 8185 is a prime number, we need to test its divisibility by prime numbers less than its square root (approximately 90).

First, we check if 8185 is divisible by 2. If the number ends with an even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), it is divisible by 2. However, 8185 ends with an odd digit (5), so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check for divisibility by 3. To do this, we sum the individual digits of 8185: 8 + 1 + 8 + 5 = 22. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, neither is 8185.

Now, we test divisibility by 5. If the number ends with 0 or 5, it is divisible by 5. However, 8185 does not end with 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

To continue verifying if 8185 is prime, we can check divisibility by prime numbers greater than 5, such as 7, 11, 13, and so on. However, these divisibility tests can become cumbersome and time-consuming, especially for larger numbers like 8185.

Alternatively, we can use a calculator or computer program to quickly determine whether 8185 is a prime number. In this case, 8185 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 5 and 23.
###
Yes, 8185 is a composite number.

To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can start by finding the prime factorization of 8185.

The prime factorization of 8185 is 5 * 59 * 29.

Since 8185 has factors other than 1 and itself, it is considered a composite number.
###
To determine whether 8185 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can try dividing 8185 by prime numbers starting from 2 and going up to the square root of 8185 (approximately 90.39).

If any of these prime numbers divide evenly into 8185, then 8185 is a composite number. Otherwise, it is prime.

Let's do the calculation.

Next, we can check divisibility by odd numbers. We can start with 3, and keep checking all odd numbers up to the square root of 9395, which is approximately 97.

Upon checking, we find that 9395 is divisible by 5 since when we divide it by 5, we get 1879. Therefore, it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 9395 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 9395 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we need to find the prime factors of 9395. We can start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2. 

9395 ÷ 2 = 4697.5

Since 4697.5 is not an integer, we can conclude that 2 is not a factor of 9395. 

Next, we can try dividing 9395 by the next prime number, 3. 

9395 ÷ 3 = 3131.6667

Again, 3131.6667 is not an integer, so 3 is not a factor of 9395. 

We can continue trying higher prime numbers, but it is apparent that 9395 does not have any prime factors. 

Therefore, 9395 is not a composite number since it only has itself and 1 as factors. It is a prime number.

Let's check if 4413 is divisible by any prime numbers:

1. Checking divisibility by 2: 4413 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

2. Checking divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of 4413 is 4 + 4 + 1 + 3 = 12, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 4413 is divisible by 3.

Since 4413 is divisible by 3, it is not a prime number.

Therefore, 4413 is not a prime number.
###

###
To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to see if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To check if 4413 is composite, we can start by finding its factors:
1 × 4413
3 × 1471

From these calculations, we see that 4413 has factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 4413 is a composite number.

###
No, 9754 is not a prime number. It can be factored into 2 x 4877.
###
To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself.

Step 1: Start by checking if 9754 is divisible by 2. Dividing it by 2 gives us 4877. 9754 is not divisible by 2.

Step 2: We can skip checking divisibility by even numbers greater than 2, as any number ending in an even digit would be divisible by 2.

Step 3: Now, let's check divisibility by odd numbers. We start with 3 and continue up to the square root of 9754 (approximately 98.75).

3: 9754 ÷ 3 = 3251.333...
4: 9754 ÷ 4 = 2438.5...
5: 9754 ÷ 5 = 1950.8...
6: 9754 ÷ 6 = 1625.666...
7: 9754 ÷ 7 = 1393.428...

98: 9754 ÷ 98 = 99.552...
99: 9754 ÷ 99 = 98.585...
98.75: 9754 ÷ 98.75 = 98.82...

Since there are no whole number results in the range of 3 to approximately 98.75, we can conclude that 9754 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 9754 is a prime number.
###

No, 5241 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 5241 is a prime number, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Divide 5241 by numbers from 2 to the square root of 5241 (rounded up to the nearest whole number).

Step 2: If any of these numbers divide evenly into 5241 (i.e., without leaving a remainder), then 5241 is not a prime number. Otherwise, it is a prime number.

Let's apply these steps to 5241:

The square root of 5241 is approximately 72.37 (rounded up to 73).

Now, let's divide 5241 by numbers from 2 to 73:

5241 ÷ 2 = 2620.5 (not divisible)
5241 ÷ 3 = 1747 (not divisible)
5241 ÷ 4 = 1310.25 (not divisible)
5241 ÷ 5 = 1048.2 (not divisible)
...
5241 ÷ 73 = 71.82 (not divisible)

We have checked numbers up to the square root of 5241 (73) and found that none of them divide evenly into 5241. Therefore, 5241 is a prime number.

Conclusion: Yes, 5241 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 5241 is a composite number. A composite number is any positive integer greater than 1 that is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 5241 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

The first step is to find its prime factors. We can use the factorization method to do this.

Let's divide 5241 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. However, 5241 is not divisible by 2, as the sum of its digits is 12, which is not divisible by 3.

Next, we divide 5241 by 3, which is the next prime number. If the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 3, then the number itself is also divisible by 3.

Sum of the digits of 5241: 5 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 12.

Since 12 is divisible by 3, so is 5241. 

5241 ÷ 3 = 1747.

Now, we have found 3 as a prime factor of 5241. To find if there are any more prime factors, we can repeat the process and divide 1747 further. 

However, if there are no prime factors other than 3, then we can conclude that 5241 is a prime number.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 4839 is 4 + 8 + 3 + 9 = 24. Since 24 is divisible by 3, we know that 4839 is also divisible by 3.

Therefore, 4839 is not a prime number, as it is divisible by 3.
###
Yes, 4839 is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has more than two positive divisors, which means it is not prime.
###
To determine whether a number is composite, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

The square root of 4839 is approximately 69.6 (rounded to one decimal place). To find the factors of 4839, we can check if any numbers from 2 to 69 divide evenly into it. 

Starting with 2, we find that it does not divide evenly into 4839. Checking other numbers, we also find that none of them divide evenly into 4839. 

Therefore, 4839 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. 

Since 4839 does not have any other factors, it is not a composite number. It is a prime number.

First, we find the square root of 5919, which is approximately 76.92.

Next, we check if 5919 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 76.

Starting with 2, we divide 5919 by 2, but it does not divide evenly:
5919 ÷ 2 = 2959.5 (not an integer)

Next, we move to 3. Again, it does not divide evenly:
5919 ÷ 3 = 1973 (not an integer)

We continue testing divisibility with prime numbers up to 76 (skipping even numbers greater than 2), but we do not find any factors.

Therefore, we conclude that 5919 is a prime number, as it is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.
###
Yes, 5919 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 5919 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To find the factors of 5919, we can divide it by numbers in a systematic manner. Starting with the smallest prime number 2, we can check if it divides 5919 evenly.

Let's divide 5919 by 2:

5919 ÷ 2 = 2959 remainder 1

Since 2 does not divide 5919 evenly, let's move on to the next prime number, 3:

5919 ÷ 3 = 1973 remainder 0

It divides evenly! This means that 3 is a factor of 5919.

So far, the factors we have found are 1, 3, and 5919.

Next, let's divide 5919 by 4, 5, 6, and so on, until we reach a number that is close to the square root of 5919.

Dividing by 4:

5919 ÷ 4 = 1479 remainder 3

Dividing by 5:

5919 ÷ 5 = 1183 remainder 4

Dividing by 6:

5919 ÷ 6 = 986 remainder 3

Dividing by 7:

5919 ÷ 7 = 845 remainder 4

And so on...

By continuing this process, we find that 5919 does not have any other factors besides 1, 3, and 5919 itself. Therefore, it is a prime number, not a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes, 5919 is divisible by 1973.
###
Yes, 3595 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 3595 is a prime number, we can check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

Starting with the smallest prime number, 2, we find that 3595 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we move on to the next prime number, 3. Adding the digits of 3595, we get 3 + 5 + 9 + 5 = 22. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, 3595 is also not divisible by 3.

Continuing this process for prime numbers up to 59, we find that 3595 is not divisible by any of them.

Therefore, we can conclude that 3595 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 3595 is a composite number.
###
Yes, let's think step by step.

To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

In the case of 3595, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers from 2 to the square root of 3595.

The prime numbers less than the square root of 3595 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23.

Checking divisibility by these prime numbers:

3595 ÷ 2 = 1797.5 (not a whole number)
3595 ÷ 3 = 1198.3 (not a whole number)
3595 ÷ 5 = 719 (not a whole number)
3595 ÷ 7 = 513.6 (not a whole number)
3595 ÷ 11 = 326.8 (not a whole number)
3595 ÷ 13 = 276.5 (not a whole number)
3595 ÷ 17 = 211.5 (not a whole number)
3595 ÷ 19 = 189.2 (not a whole number)
3595 ÷ 23 = 156.3 (not a whole number)

Since none of these divisions result in whole numbers, we can conclude that 3595 is not divisible evenly by any prime numbers.

Therefore, 3595 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Hence, 3595 is a prime number, not a composite number.

No, 8254 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2, 3, 7, 17, and 19.
###
To determine if 8254 is a prime number, we can check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.
First, let's check if it is divisible by 2. 

8254 ÷ 2 = 4127

Since 8254 is divisible by 2, it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 8254 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 8254 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than itself and 1.

To find these factors, we can start by dividing 8254 by smaller numbers and see if any evenly divide it without leaving a remainder. If we find any factors, then we know 8254 is a composite number.

Let's begin by checking if 2 is a factor of 8254:
8254 ÷ 2 = 4127

Since 2 does not evenly divide 8254 without leaving a remainder, we can move on and check the next number, which is 3.

8254 ÷ 3 = 2751.333...

Again, we have a remainder, so 3 is not a factor of 8254.

Next, let's try 4:

8254 ÷ 4 = 2063.5

Once again, we have a remainder, so 4 is not a factor.

We can continue this process with other numbers, but based on the pattern so far, it seems that 8254 is not a composite number because no smaller numbers divide it evenly.

Therefore, 8254 is a prime number.

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. Dividing 3903 by 2 results in a decimal, so it is not divisible by 2. 

Then we can check if it is divisible by 3. To find out, we add the digits of 3903 (3 + 9 + 0 + 3) and get 15. Since 15 is divisible by 3 (15 ÷ 3 = 5), it means that 3903 is also divisible by 3.

Therefore, 3903 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 3.

2. Next, we check if 9934 is divisible by any odd numbers up to the square root of 9934. The square root of 9934 is approximately 99.67. We don't need to check beyond this point because any larger divisor would have a corresponding smaller divisor already checked.

Checking for division by odd numbers up to 99, we find that 9934 ÷ 3 = 3311.333 (not a whole number), 9934 ÷ 5 = 1986.8 (not a whole number), 9934 ÷ 7 = 1419.143 (not a whole number), 9934 ÷ 11 = 903.091 (not a whole number), 9934 ÷ 13 = 763.385 (not a whole number), 9934 ÷ 17 = 584.353 (not a whole number), 9934 ÷ 19 = 522.842 (not a whole number), 9934 ÷ 23 = 431.913 (not a whole number), 9934 ÷ 29 = 342.207 (not a whole number), 9934 ÷ 31 = 320.13 (not a whole number), 9934 ÷ 37 = 268.703 (not a whole number), 9934 ÷ 41 = 242.098 (not a whole number), 9934 ÷ 43 = 230.791 (not a whole number), 9934 ÷ 47 = 211.128 (not a whole number), 9934 ÷ 53 = 187.509 (not a whole number), 9934 ÷ 59 = 168.203 (not a whole number), 9934 ÷ 61 = 162.902 (not a whole number), 9934 ÷ 67 = 148.239 (not a whole number), 9934 ÷ 71 = 139.873 (not a whole number), 9934 ÷ 73 = 136.095 (not a whole number), 9934 ÷ 79 = 125.918 (not a whole number), 9934 ÷ 83 = 119.553 (not a whole number), 9934 ÷ 89 = 111.464 (not a whole number), and 9934 ÷ 97 = 102.433 (not a whole number).

3. Since 9934 is not divisible by any numbers up to its square root, it has been shown to not have any divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 9934 is a prime number.

So, yes, 9934 is a prime number.
###

1 is always a factor of any number, so 9934 is divisible by 1.
To check if it is divisible by any other numbers, we can divide 9934 by all numbers from 2 to the square root of 9934 (rounded down).

Let's calculate the square root of 9934: √9934 ≈ 99.669.

Now we can divide 9934 by numbers from 2 to 99.

9934 ÷ 2 = 4967 remainder 0
9934 ÷ 3 = 3311 remainder 1
9934 ÷ 4 = 2483 remainder 2
9934 ÷ 5 = 1986 remainder 4
...and so on.

By continuing this process, we find that 9934 is divisible by 2, 7, 59, 89, and 133. Therefore, it has factors other than 1 and itself.

Since 9934 has factors other than 1 and itself, it is a composite number.

###
To determine if 1405 is a prime number, we can check for divisibility by any numbers up to its square root, which is approximately 37.5. 

We check if 1405 is divisible by 2, but it is not since it is an odd number. 

Next, we check if 1405 is divisible by 3. Summing its digits, we get 1 + 4 + 0 + 5 = 10. Since 10 is not divisible by 3, 1405 is also not divisible by 3. 

Continue this process up to 37, and if no divisor is found, then 1405 is a prime number. 

However, for 1405, we find that it is divisible by 5 since the last digit is 5. Thus, 1405 is not a prime number.

###
To check if 9777 is a prime number, we can follow the following steps:

Step 1: Start by dividing 9777 by 2. If it is divisible by 2, then it is not a prime number.

9777 ÷ 2 = 4888.5 (not an integer)

Since 9777 is not divisible by 2, we can move on to the next step.

Step 2: Divide 9777 by all odd numbers greater than 2 up to the square root of 9777.

9777 ÷ 3 = 3259 (not divisible)
9777 ÷ 5 = 1955.4 (not divisible)
9777 ÷ 7 = 1396.7 (not divisible)
9777 ÷ 9 = 1086.3 (not divisible)
9777 ÷ 11 = 888.8 (not divisible)
9777 ÷ 13 = 752.5 (not divisible)
9777 ÷ 15 = 651.8 (not divisible)

Since we have checked all the numbers up to the square root of 9777, and it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 9777 is a prime number.

Therefore, 9777 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 9777 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 9777 is a composite number, we need to check if it can be divided evenly by any numbers other than 1 and itself. 

We start by finding the square root of 9777, which is approximately 98.87. 

Next, we check if 9777 is divisible by any numbers from 2 to 98. Since 9777 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

We try dividing 9777 by 3. The quotient is approximately 3259, which is not a whole number. 

Continuing this process, we try dividing 9777 by 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and so on, up to 98. However, none of these numbers divide 9777 evenly.

Since we have exhausted all possible divisors up to the square root of 9777 without finding any divisors other than 1 and 9777 itself, we can conclude that 9777 is a prime number.

###
To determine if 4145 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. 

Let's check for divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 4145 (which is approximately 64).

Starting with 2, we see that 4145 is not divisible by 2.

Moving on to 3, the sum of its digits is 4+1+4+5 = 14, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 4145 is not divisible by 3.

Next, we check for divisibility by 5. If the last digit of a number is 5 or 0, it is divisible by 5. However, 4145 does not end in 5 or 0, so it is not divisible by 5.

Similarly, we check for divisibility by 7. The alternating sum of its digits is (4-1+4-5) = 2, which is not divisible by 7. Hence, 4145 is not divisible by 7.

Continuing with this process, we find that 4145 is not divisible by any numbers up to 64.

Therefore, we can conclude that 4145 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 4145 is a composite number. It has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 4145 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can try to divide 4145 by every number from 2 up to its square root (rounded up to the nearest whole number). If it divides evenly with any of these numbers, then 4145 is composite. Otherwise, it is prime.

Calculating the square root of 4145:

√4145 ≈ 64.36

Now let's try dividing 4145 by all numbers from 2 up to 65:

4145 ÷ 2 = 2072.5 (not divisible)
4145 ÷ 3 = 1381.67 (not divisible)
...
4145 ÷ 65 = 63.77 (not divisible)

We have tried dividing 4145 by all numbers up to 65 without finding any divisors. Therefore, we can conclude that 4145 is a prime number and not composite.

###
To determine if 2866 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If a number is even, it can be divided by 2. 
2866 ÷ 2 = 1433.

1433 is an odd number. To check if it is divisible by 3, we can add its digits together and check if the sum is divisible by 3.

1 + 4 + 3 + 3 = 11. 
Since 11 is not divisible by 3, 1433 is not divisible by 3.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any prime numbers larger than 3. We can start with 5.

1433 is not divisible by 5 as it does not end in 0 or 5.

We can continue checking divisibility by prime numbers until we reach the square root of 2866, which is approximately 53.53. If we don't find any divisors until this point, then 2866 is prime.

Dividing 1433 by prime numbers between 7 and 53 (inclusive), we find that it is not divisible by any of them.

Therefore, 2866 is a prime number since it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 2866 is a composite number because it is divisible by 2 and 1433.
###
To determine if 2866 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Let's start by finding the prime factors of 2866. We can divide it by prime numbers and see if any of them divide evenly.

The prime factorization of 2866 is:

2866 = 2 * 1433

Since no other prime numbers divide 1433, we can conclude that 2866 is a composite number.

Therefore, 2866 is a composite number.

First, we know that prime numbers are integers greater than 1, so we can eliminate any numbers less than or equal to 1.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root, which is approximately √1589 ≈ 39.87. So, we can check divisibility by prime numbers up to 39.

Starting with 2, we find that 1589 is not divisible by 2 since it is an odd number.

Next, we check divisibility by 3. Adding up the digits of 1589, we get 1 + 5 + 8 + 9 = 23. Since 23 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 1589 is also not divisible by 3.

Similarly, we check divisibility by other prime numbers less than 39: 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. However, none of these prime numbers divide 1589.

Thus, we can conclude that 1589 is a prime number since it is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

Therefore, 1589 is a prime number.

The square root of 1589 is approximately 39.86.

We can start by checking the divisibility of 1589 by prime numbers starting from 2, 3, 5, and so on.

Dividing 1589 by 2: 1589 ÷ 2 = 794.5 (not divisible without a fraction)

Dividing 1589 by 10: 1589 ÷ 10 = 158.9 (not divisible without a fraction)

We continue this process until we reach 39.86, but as you can see, none of the prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 1589 evenly divide it.

Since there are no factors other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that 1589 is a prime number and not a composite number.

We can check if 1329 is divisible by 2. However, since 1329 is not even, it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits, 1 + 3 + 2 + 9, is equal to 15. Since 15 is divisible by 3, we conclude that 1329 is also divisible by 3. 

Therefore, 1329 is not a prime number since it is divisible by 3. Its factors are 3 and 443.
###

2. Check if the number is divisible by 3: 5 + 0 + 6 + 2 = 13, and 13 is not divisible by 3. Thus, 5062 is not divisible by 3.

3. Continue to check divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 5062, which is approximately 71.13. Checking numbers beyond the square root is unnecessary since any factors will have corresponding factors less than the square root.

4. Check if the number is divisible by 5: 5062 ends with the digit 2, which is not divisible by 5. Therefore, 5062 is not divisible by 5.

5. Check if the number is divisible by any prime number greater than 5 and less than 71: We need to check 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, and 61. None of these numbers divide evenly into 5062.

Since 5062 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to its square root, we can conclude that 5062 is a prime number.

Thus, 5062 is a prime number.

5062 ÷ 2 = 2531

Since the division is exact (no remainder), we have determined that 2 is a factor of 5062.

To further investigate if 5062 is a composite number, we can continue to divide it by other prime numbers. However, after checking the divisibility criteria for prime numbers up to √5062 (approximately 71), we find that there are no other prime factors of 5062.

- 6415 ÷ 67 = 95.75 (not an integer)
- 6415 ÷ 71 = 90.21 (not an integer)
- 6415 ÷ 73 = 87.88 (not an integer)

As none of the primes less than or equal to the square root of 6415 evenly divide into 6415, we can conclude that 6415 is a prime number.
###
No, 6415 is not a composite number. It is a prime number because it only has two distinct positive divisors: 1 and 6415 itself.
###
To determine if 6415 is a composite number, we need to check if it can be divided evenly by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we check if it is divisible by 2. The sum of its digits, 6 + 4 + 1 + 5, is 16, which is not divisible by 2. Therefore, 6415 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits, 16, is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 6415 is not divisible by 3.

We continue checking divisibility by higher prime numbers, such as and 5 and 7, but none divide 6415 evenly.

Since we have checked all the primes less than the square root of 6415 (which is approximately 80), and found no divisors, we can conclude that 6415 is a prime number.

Therefore, 6415 is not a composite number.

We can start by finding the square root of 2391, which is approximately 48.88. 

Then, we can check if 2391 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 48.88. 

We check for divisibility by 2, but since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we check for divisibility by 3. Adding up the digits of 2391, we get 2 + 3 + 9 + 1 = 15, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 2391 is divisible by 3.

Since 2391 is divisible by 3, it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 2391 is a composite number.
2391 can be written as a product of prime numbers:

###
To determine if 3415 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

To check for divisibility, we can start by dividing 3415 by 2. If the result is a whole number, then 3415 is not a prime number. 

So, let's calculate: 3415 divided by 2 equals 1707.5, which is not a whole number. 

Since 3415 is not divisible by 2, we can continue checking for divisibility by dividing it by odd numbers up to its square root (rounded up). 

The square root of 3415 is approximately 58.44. So, we will check divisibility by odd numbers up to 59. 

By doing this, we find that 3415 is divisible by 5 since 3415 divided by 5 equals 683, which is a whole number. 

Therefore, 3415 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 5.
###
Yes, 3415 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this step by step, we can start by finding the square root of the number. The square root of 3415 is approximately 58.46 (rounded to two decimal places). 

Next, we check if any number from 2 up to 58 (inclusive) divides evenly into 3415. 

Looking at the numbers from 2 to 58, we find that 3415 is divisible by 5 (685 times) and 683 (which is a prime number). 

Since 3415 has factors other than 1 and itself (5 and 683), it is a composite number.
###

Yes.
###
No, 3561 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 7 and 509.
###
To determine if 3561 is a prime number, we can use a process called prime factorization, which involves checking if the number can be divided evenly by any prime numbers less than its square root.

To start, we can divide 3561 by the prime numbers starting from 2 and increasing by 1 until we reach the square root of 3561.

The square root of 3561 is approximately 59.68, so we only need to check for divisibility by prime numbers up to 59.

When we divide 3561 by 2, we get a result of 1780.5, which is not a whole number. Therefore, 2 is not a factor of 3561.

Next, if we divide 3561 by 3, we get a result of 1187, which is a whole number. This means that 3 is a factor of 3561.

Continuing with this process, we divide 3561 by 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, and 59. In each case, we find that these numbers do not divide evenly into 3561, as we obtain decimal results.

Therefore, the prime factors of 3561 are just 3 and 1187.

Since the only prime factors of 3561 are 3 and itself, and there are no other prime factors, we can conclude that 3561 is a prime number.
###
No, 3561 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

Starting with the number 2, we can check if it evenly divides into 3561. If it does, then 3561 is composite. 

Dividing 3561 by 2 gives a result of 1780.5, which means that 2 is not a factor of 3561. 

We can continue the process by trying other numbers. We can check if 3 divides into 3561. 

If we add up the digits of 3561 (3 + 5 + 6 + 1), we get 15. Since 15 is divisible by 3 (3 * 5 = 15), 3561 is also divisible by 3. 

Dividing 3561 by 3 gives a result of 1187. 

We continue the process by dividing 3561 by other numbers, but let's quickly check if it is divisible by 4. 

For a number to be divisible by 4, its last two digits must form a number that is divisible by 4. The last two digits of 3561 are 61, and since 61 is not divisible by 4, we know that 3561 is not divisible by 4. 

We could continue checking divisibility by more numbers, but from our current calculations, we can conclude that 3561 is divisible by 3 and not divisible by 4. 

Therefore, 3561 is a composite number.

First, we check if 5079 is divisible by 2. Since 5079 is an odd number (ends with 9), it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we check if 5079 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits, 5 + 0 + 7 + 9, is 21, which is divisible by 3. This means that 5079 is also divisible by 3.

Therefore, 5079 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 3.
###

###
To determine if 7091 is a prime number, one way is to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. We can find divisors by checking numbers up to the square root of 7091, which is approximately 84.

Let's test if 7091 is divisible by any numbers between 2 and 84.

1. 7091 ÷ 2 = 3545.5 (not divisible)
2. 7091 ÷ 3 = 2363.67 (not divisible)
3. 7091 ÷ 4 = 1772.75 (not divisible)
4. 7091 ÷ 5 = 1418.2 (not divisible)

###
To determine whether 7091 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any of the numbers other than 1 and itself.

Firstly, let's find the factors of 7091 by checking the divisibility with numbers up to its square root (√7091 ≈ 84.23). 

Starting with 2, we find that 7091 is not divisible by 2. 
Moving on to 3, we find that 7091 is not divisible by 3.
Then, testing with 4, 5, 6, and so on, up to 84, we also find that none of these numbers divide 7091 without leaving a remainder.

Since there are no numbers other than 1 and 7091 that divide it without remainder, 7091 is not divisible by any other number. Hence, 7091 is a prime number.

In conclusion, 7091 is a prime number, not a composite number.

Next, we try dividing 1687 by 3. Again, it is not divisible (remainder is 2). 

We continue this process, testing division by the numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, and so on. Until we reach 40, we find that 1687 is not divisible by any of these numbers.

###
To determine if 6242 is a prime number, we can check for its factors. If there are any factors other than 1 and itself, then it is not a prime number.

We can start by dividing 6242 by 2: 
6242 ÷ 2 = 3121

Since 3121 is not an integer, we can move on to the next prime number, which is 3:
6242 ÷ 3 = 2080.6667

Again, we get a non-integer result, so we proceed to the next prime number, which is 5:
6242 ÷ 5 = 1248.4

Still, we obtain a non-integer result, so we continue checking with the next prime number, which is 7:
6242 ÷ 7 = 891.7143

Once more, we obtain a non-integer result. We can continue with the next few prime numbers, but we can see a pattern emerging: the divisions will always result in non-integers. With this observation, we can conclude that there are no factors of 6242 other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 6242 is indeed a prime number.
###
Yes, 6242 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether 6242 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any other numbers besides 1 and itself.

The first step is to find the prime factorization of 6242. We can start by testing if it is divisible by 2, which it is not because 6242 is an odd number.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. Adding the digits together, we get 6 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 14. Since 14 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 6242 is not divisible by 3 either.

We can continue this process and try dividing by other prime numbers such as 5, 7, 11, etc. However, by observing that the last digit of 6242 is 2, we realize that it is not divisible by 5.

After checking for divisibility by multiple small primes, if we find no factors other than 1 and itself, then we can conclude that the number is prime. In this case, we have checked for divisibility by several primes, and since we have found no factors, 6242 is a prime number.

No, 6898 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2 and 3449.
###
To determine if 6898 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can find the square root of 6898, which is approximately 83.06. 

Now, we will check if 6898 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 83.06.

Starting with 2, we can see that 6898 is not divisible by 2 since it is an even number.

Moving on to 3, we find that the sum of the digits of 6898 is 6+8+9+8=31, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 6898 is not divisible by 3.

###
To determine if 7985 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Divisibility by 2
Since 7985 ends in the digit 5, which is odd, it is not divisible by 2. 

Step 2: Divisibility by 3
To check if 7985 is divisible by 3, we can add up its digits: 7 + 9 + 8 + 5 = 29. Since 29 is not divisible by 3, neither is 7985.

Step 3: Divisibility by 5
Again, since 7985 ends in 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Step 4: Divisibility by other prime numbers
We would need to perform further calculations to check for divisibility by other prime numbers, such as 7, 11, 13, etc.

However, based on the steps above, we have ruled out divisibility by 2, 3, and 5. Therefore, it is likely that 7985 is a prime number.

###
Yes, 7985 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 7985 is a composite number, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 7985 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can move on to other divisors.

Next, let's check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we sum the digits of 7985: 7 + 9 + 8 + 5 = 29. Since 29 is not divisible by 3, we can rule out 3 as a factor.

Now let's check if 7985 is divisible by 5 or any of its multiples (10, 15, 20, etc.). Since the last digit of 7985 is 5, it is divisible by 5.

The prime factorization of 7985 can be found by dividing it by the lowest prime factor found so far which is 5.

7985 ÷ 5 = 1597

1597 is a prime number, and since there are no other factors of 7985, we can conclude that it is a prime number, not a composite number.

So, 7985 is not a composite number, it is a prime number.

2. Check if 9957 is divisible by any prime numbers up to its square root.
3. Start checking for divisibility starting from 2 up to 99, since the highest prime number less than 99 is 97.

Now, let's go through the process of checking for divisibility:

1. Divide 9957 by 2: 9957 ÷ 2 = 4978.5
   Since the result is not an integer, 9957 is not divisible by 2.

2. Divide 9957 by 3: 9957 ÷ 3 = 3319
   The result is an integer, so 9957 is divisible by 3.

Since 9957 is divisible by 3, we conclude that it is not a prime number.

9957 = 3 × 3319

Thus, the prime factorization of 9957 is 3 × 3319.
###
Yes, 9957 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 9957 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, let's find the square root of 9957. The square root of 9957 is approximately 99.78.

Next, we can check if 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 99 divide evenly into 9957. By doing this, we can determine if any factors exist between 1 and the square root of 9957.

After checking, we find that no integer factors exist between 1 and 99 that divide evenly into 9957. Therefore, we can conclude that 9957 is a prime number, not a composite number.

1985 ÷ 2 = 992 remainder 1

Step 2: Move on to the next prime number, which is 3. Again, check if 1985 is divisible by 3. If it is, then it is not a prime number. Otherwise, proceed to the next step.

1985 ÷ 3 = 661 remainder 2

Step 3: Continue this process with the remaining prime numbers, which are 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on. However, we don't need to go beyond the square root of 1985, which is approximately 44.55.

1985 is not divisible evenly by any prime numbers up to 44. Therefore, we can conclude that 1985 is a prime number since it does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 1985 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 1985 is a composite number, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, let's identify the factors of 1985. We can start by dividing 1985 by the smallest prime number, 2. However, 1985 is an odd number, and it doesn't end with an even digit, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if 1985 is divisible by the next prime number, 3. By adding the digits of 1985, we get 1+9+8+5 = 23. Since 23 is not divisible by 3, 1985 is also not divisible by 3.

Now, we move on to the next prime number, 5. If a number ends with 0 or 5, it is divisible by 5. However, 1985 does not end with 5 or 0, so it is not divisible by 5.

Since we have checked all the primes up to the square root of 1985 (which is approximately 44.5), and none of them divide 1985, we can conclude that 1985 is a prime number and not a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes. 1985 is divisible by 397.
###
Yes, 8678 is not a prime number. It can be divided by 2 and 433, among other numbers.
###
To determine if 8678 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If the last digit of a number is even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), then the entire number is divisible by 2. In this case, the last digit of 8678 is 8, so it is divisible by 2.

Therefore, 8678 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2.
###
Yes, 8678 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 8678 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Find the square root of 8678. The square root of 8678 is approximately 93.22.

Step 2: Check for factors by dividing 8678 by numbers from 2 to 93. Since 8678 is an even number, we can start by checking divisibility by 2.

By dividing 8678 by 2, we get 4339. Since 4339 is not a whole number, 2 is not a factor.

By dividing 8678 by 3, we get 2892.67. Again, 3 is not a factor.

By dividing 8678 by 4, we get 2169.5. 4 is not a factor.

By dividing 8678 by 5, we get 1735.6. 5 is not a factor.

By dividing 8678 by 6, we get 1446.33. 6 is not a factor.

By continuing this process, we find that 7, 8, 9, and so on are not factors of 8678.

Step 3: Since 8678 has been divided by all the numbers from 2 to its square root without resulting in a whole number, we can conclude that it does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 8678 is a composite number.
###

###
Yes.
###
No, 7778 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 7778 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, let's check if it is divisible by 2. If a number is even, it is always divisible by 2. If we divide 7778 by 2, we get a quotient of 3889. 

Next, let's check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we need to add the digits of 7778 and check if the sum is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits is 7 + 7 + 7 + 8 = 29, which is not divisible by 3.

Then, let's check if it is divisible by 5. If a number ends in 0 or 5, it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit of 7778 is 8, it is not divisible by 5.

Finally, let's check if it is divisible by 7 using the divisibility rule for 7. We double the last digit and subtract it from the truncated number formed by removing the last digit. If the result is divisible by 7, then the whole number is divisible by 7. In this case, we have 777 - (2 * 8) = 777 - 16 = 761. Since 761 is not divisible by 7, 7778 is not divisible by 7.

Since 7778 is not divisible by any of these prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7), we can conclude that 7778 is a prime number.
###
No, 7778 is not a composite number. It is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 7778 is a composite number, we need to think step by step and analyze its factors.

First, we should check if 7778 is divisible by any number from 2 to its square root. Taking the square root of 7778, we get approximately 88.16.

Next, we try dividing 7778 by numbers from 2 to 88 to check for any whole number quotients. 

After performing the division, we find that 7778 is divisible by 2: 7778 ÷ 2 = 3889. 

Since the division by 2 gave us a whole number quotient, we can deduce that 7778 is divisible by 2. 

Therefore, 7778 is a composite number since it has factors other than 1 and itself.

###
No, 7165 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 7165 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number (ends with 5), we can skip checking divisibility by 2.

Next, we can check divisibility by 3. If the sum of the digits in a number is divisible by 3, the number itself is also divisible by 3. The sum of the digits in 7165 is 7 + 1 + 6 + 5 = 19, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 7165 is also not divisible by 3.

We continue to check divisors until we reach the square root of 7165. Checking divisibility by higher prime numbers such as 5, 7, or 11 would require more time, so we stop at the square root of 7165.

The square root of 7165 is approximately 84.742.

We can check divisibility by numbers up to 85.

Upon checking, we find that 7165 is divisible by 5 (7165 ÷ 5 = 1433).

Therefore, 7165 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 5.
###
Yes, 7165 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it can be divided evenly by any number other than 1 and itself.

To find the answer step by step, we start by checking if 7165 is divisible by 2. If it is divisible by 2, then it is a composite number.

The last digit of 7165 is 5, which means it is not divisible by 2. Hence, we continue to the next step.

Next, we check if 7165 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up the individual digits of the number and check if the sum is divisible by 3.

7 + 1 + 6 + 5 = 19

19 is not divisible by 3. Therefore, we can conclude that 7165 is not divisible by 3.

Continuing to the next step, we check if 7165 is divisible by 5. If the number ends with 0 or 5, then it is divisible by 5.

Since 7165 does not end with 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Finally, we check if 7165 is divisible by 7. There is no simple trick to quickly determine divisibility by 7, so we would need to perform long division or use a calculator.

Performing long division, we find that 7165 divided by 7 equals 1023 with a remainder of 4. 

Since there is a remainder other than 0, we can conclude that 7165 is not divisible by 7.

Since we have checked divisibility by 2, 3, 5, and 7, and 7165 is not divisible by any of those numbers, we can conclude that 7165 is not a composite number.

Therefore, 7165 is a prime number.

We start checking if 7702 is divisible by 2. 7702 divided by 2 equals 3851, which is not a whole number. Therefore, 7702 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check if 7702 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits is 7 + 7 + 0 + 2 = 16. Since 16 is not divisible by 3, 7702 is not divisible by 3.

We continue checking if 7702 is divisible by numbers up to 88. However, it is not necessary to check all the numbers as we can make an observation. The last digit of 7702 is 2, which means it is not divisible by 2, 5, or any number ending with 5. Since we have already checked for divisibility by 2, we can conclude that 7702 is not divisible by 5.

Therefore, we can conclude that 7702 is not divisible by any number from 2 to 88, making it a prime number.
###

First, we check if 7702 is divisible by 2. Performing the division, we find that 7702 divided by 2 is 3851 with a remainder of 0.

Thus, 2 is a factor of 7702. 

Next, we check if 7702 is divisible by any other numbers up to its square root, which is approximately 87.8. We can then test if any numbers between 3 and 87 divide 7702 evenly.

By performing these calculations, we determine that 7702 is not divisible by any number between 3 and 87.

Therefore, the only factors of 7702 are 1, 2, 3851, and 7702.

Since 7702 has factors other than 1 and itself, it is a composite number.
###

Yes, 7217 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 7217 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, let's check for divisibility by 2. Being an even number, if 7217 were divisible by 2, it would not be a prime number. However, 7217 is not divisible by 2, as it does not end in an even number. 

Next, let's check for divisibility by 3. We add up the digits of 7217: 7 + 2 + 1 + 7 = 17. Since 17 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 7217 is not divisible by 3.

We could continue with larger prime numbers, but we can realize that 7217 lies between the consecutive squares of the prime numbers:  49 (7^2) and 81 (9^2). Therefore, we can conclude that any potential factors of 7217 would also lie in the range of 1 and 7, which we have already checked.

Conclusion: 3805 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 3805 is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has more than two positive divisors. In the case of 3805, its prime factors are 5, 761, and 1.
###
To determine if 3805 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2.
Since the last digit of the number is 5, it is odd and not divisible by 2.

Step 2: Check divisibility by 3.
To check if a number is divisible by 3, we sum its digits. 
3 + 8 + 0 + 5 = 16.
Since 16 is not divisible by 3, 3805 is not divisible by 3.

Step 3: Check divisibility by 5.
If the last digit of a number is 0 or 5, it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit of 3805 is 5, it is divisible by 5.

Therefore, 3805 is a composite number since it has factors other than 1 and itself (5 and 761).

Upon examination, we find that 9358 is divisible by 2 as it yields the quotient 4679. Therefore, 2 is a factor of 9358. 

Also, upon further division, we discover that 9358 is divisible by 41, as it yields the quotient 228. 

Thus, since 9358 has factors other than 1 and itself, namely 2 and 41, it is a composite number.
###
Yes
###
Yes, 9358 is divisible by 4679.
###
No, 2495 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 5 and 499.
###
To determine if a number is prime, we can check for factors of the number other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can try dividing the number 2495 by all the numbers between 2 and the square root of the number rounded up (which is approximately 49).

When we divide 2495 by the numbers between 2 and 49, we find that it is divisible by 5 and 499. 

Since 2495 has factors other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 2495 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we must check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can start by finding the factors of 2495. We can do this by checking all numbers less than or equal to the square root of 2495, as any factors larger than the square root would have corresponding factors smaller than the square root.

The square root of 2495 is approximately 49.95.

Now let's check if any numbers between 2 and 49.95 divide evenly into 2495.

If we start with the number 2 and divide 2495 by it, we get a quotient of 1247.5, which is not a whole number. Therefore, 2 is not a factor of 2495.

If we move on to the number 3 and divide 2495 by it, we again get a non-whole number quotient. Therefore, 3 is not a factor of 2495.

By repeating this process for the remaining numbers between 2 and 49, we do not find any factors of 2495.

Since we were unable to find any factors other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that 2495 is a prime number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes.
###
No, 8735 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 8735 is a prime number, we can check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If the number ends in an even digit, it is divisible by 2. However, since 8735 ends in 5, it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. We can do this by adding up the individual digits of 8735 and seeing if the sum is divisible by 3. 8 + 7 + 3 + 5 = 23, which is not divisible by 3, so 8735 is not divisible by 3. 

Finally, we can check if it is divisible by any numbers up to the square root of 8735. However, this can be time-consuming. So, let's look at a faster approach. 

We could factorize 8735 into its prime factors. Once we find any prime factors, we know that the number is not prime. 

8735 is divisible by 5 because it ends in 5. Dividing 8735 by 5 gives us 1747. 

Now, we need to check if 1747 is a prime number. Again, we can check if it is divisible by any numbers up to its square root, but it would be quicker to factorize it. However, we will find that 1747 is a prime number. 

Therefore, since 8735 has a factor other than 1 and itself (5), it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 8735 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 8735 is a composite number, we need to check if it has more than two distinct factors. 

First, we can check if 8735 is divisible by any prime numbers. 
If a number is divisible by 2, it will end with an even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). Since 8735 ends with 5, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can see if it is divisible by 3. To check if a number is divisible by 3, we add up its individual digits and check if the sum is divisible by 3. 
8 + 7 + 3 + 5 = 23, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 8735 is not divisible by 3.

It's also not divisible by 5 since it doesn't end with a 0 or 5.

Now, let's try dividing 8735 by numbers greater than 5. We can start by testing divisibility by 7. 

If we divide 8735 by 7, the result is approximately 1247.86. Since the result is not an integer, 8735 is not divisible by 7.

Similarly, trying larger prime numbers such as 11, 13, and 17 will not yield integer results.

Therefore, we can conclude that 8735 is a prime number, as it is not divisible by any prime numbers and does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes
###
Yes.
###
No, 9194 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2, 7, 13, and 89.
###
To determine if 9194 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

First, we check if 2 is a divisor of 9194. If we divide 9194 by 2, we get 4597. 

Next, we check if 3 is a divisor of 9194. By adding up the digits of 9194 (9 + 1 + 9 + 4 = 23), we can check if 3 divides evenly into the sum. However, 3 does not divide evenly into 23.

We continue this process up until the square root of 9194, because any factors above the square root would have corresponding factors below the square root. 

By continuing this process, we find that 9194 is not divisible by any whole numbers from 2 to the square root of 9194.

Therefore, we can conclude that 9194 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 9194 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can start by identifying the factors of 9194. 

The factors of 9194 can be found by dividing it by all numbers from 1 up to the square root of 9194, and checking if the division leaves a remainder of 0. 

We can start the process by checking division by 2. 

9194 ÷ 2 = 4597, remainder 0

So, 2 is a factor of 9194. 

Next, we can check division by 3. 

9194 ÷ 3 = 3064.6666 (approximately), remainder 2

So 3 is not a factor of 9194. 

We can continue this process and check division by other numbers. However, for efficiency, we can also notice that if a number is not divisible by 3, then it is not divisible by any multiple or sum of 3 (e.g. 6, 9, 12, etc.). 

Therefore, we can conclude that the factors of 9194 are not divisible by numbers larger than 3. 

Since 9194 has factors other than 1 and itself, it is a composite number.

No, 6905 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 5 and 1381.
###
To determine if 6905 is a prime number, we can use the following steps:

1. Take the square root of 6905, which is approximately 83.08.
2. Divide 6905 by prime numbers less than or equal to 83.08.
3. If there is any prime number that divides 6905 evenly, then it is not a prime number. If no such prime numbers are found, then it is a prime number.

Let's go through the calculations:

6905 ÷ 2 = 3452.5 - not a whole number
6905 ÷ 3 = 2301.666... - not a whole number
6905 ÷ 5 = 1381 - not a whole number

6905 ÷ 43 = 160.813... - not a whole number
6905 ÷ 47 = 146.914... - not a whole number
6905 ÷ 53 = 130.377... - not a whole number
6905 ÷ 59 = 116.949... - not a whole number
6905 ÷ 61 = 113.033... - not a whole number
6905 ÷ 67 = 103.134... - not a whole number
6905 ÷ 71 = 97.394... - not a whole number
6905 ÷ 73 = 94.729... - not a whole number
6905 ÷ 79 = 87.468... - not a whole number
6905 ÷ 83 = 83.433... - not a whole number

After dividing by all prime numbers less than or equal to 83, none of them divides 6905 evenly. Therefore, 6905 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Thus, 6905 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 6905 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 6905 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by finding the prime factors of 6905. We can divide it by a prime number, starting with 2:

6905 ÷ 2 = 3452.5

The result is not a whole number. Hence, 2 is not a factor of 6905.

Next, we try dividing it by 3:

6905 ÷ 3 = 2301.666...

Again, the result is not a whole number. Therefore, 3 is also not a factor of 6905.

Continuing this process, we can divide 6905 by 5:

6905 ÷ 5 = 1381

The result is a whole number. Therefore, 5 is a factor of 6905.

Now we check if there are any other prime factors between 5 and the square root of 6905. If we continue dividing by larger prime numbers, we find that 6905 is divisible by 29:

6905 ÷ 29 = 238.448...

Since the result is not a whole number, we know that 29 is a factor of 6905.

Therefore, the prime factorization of 6905 is 5 × 29.

Since 6905 has factors other than 1 and itself, namely 5 and 29, it is a composite number.
###

###
Yes, 8005 is a composite number. It can be divided by 5 and 1601.
###
To determine if 8005 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, let's find the factors of 8005 by dividing it by numbers starting from 2 up to the square root of 8005, which is approximately 89.44.

When we divide 8005 by 2, we get 4002.5, which is not a whole number.
When we divide 8005 by 3, we get 2668.333, which is not a whole number.
When we divide 8005 by 4, we get 2001.25, which is not a whole number.
And so on until we reach 89.

Now, let's check if there are any whole number divisions that give us a whole number.

When we divide 8005 by 89, we get 90.06, which is not a whole number.

Since there are no divisions that give us a whole number, we can conclude that 8005 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 8005 is a prime number, not a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes.
###
No, 1355 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 1355 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 1355 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 1355 is 1 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 14, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 1355 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue checking divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 1355, but to simplify the process, we can use divisibility rules for numbers that end in 5 or 0. Since 1355 does not end in 5 or 0, we can skip those checks.

Therefore, we can conclude that 1355 is a prime number since it is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 1355 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 1355 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

The first step is to find the prime factors of 1355. We can start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2. 

1355 ÷ 2 = 677.5

Since 677.5 is not an integer, 2 is not a factor of 1355. We move on to the next prime number, which is 3.

1355 ÷ 3 = 451.666

Again, 451.666 is not an integer, so 3 is not a factor of 1355. We continue with 5.

1355 ÷ 5 = 271

5 is a factor of 1355, and the quotient is an integer. So, 1355 is divisible by 5. 

Now, we check if there are any factors other than 1, 1355 and 5. Since we have only found 2 factors, it means that 1355 is a composite number.

Therefore, the answer is yes, 1355 is a composite number.
###
No.
###
Yes.
###
No, 5979 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3 and 199.
###
To determine if 5979 is a prime number, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

Step 1: Check if the number is divisible by 2.
The last digit of 5979 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.

Step 2: Check if the number is divisible by 3.
To determine if a number is divisible by 3, we sum up its digits and check if that sum is divisible by 3.
5 + 9 + 7 + 9 = 30. Since 30 is divisible by 3, 5979 is also divisible by 3.

Since 5979 is divisible by 3, it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 5979 is a composite number. It can be factored as 3 × 1993.
###
To determine if 5979 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If the last digit of 5979 is even, then it is divisible by 2. However, since the last digit is 9, it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 5979 is 5 + 9 + 7 + 9 = 30. Since 30 is divisible by 3, 5979 is also divisible by 3. 

So, 5979 is a composite number with factors 1, 3, 1993, and 5979.
###
Yes
###
Yes
###
No, 5374 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 2, 2687, and 5374.
###
To determine if 5374 is a prime number, we can check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we should check if it is divisible by 2. Since 5374 is an even number (the last digit is 4), it is divisible by 2.

Thus, 5374 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 2.
###
Yes, 5374 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 5374 is a composite number, we can check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If the last digit of a number is even, then the whole number is divisible by 2. In this case, the last digit of 5374 is 4, which is even. So 5374 is divisible by 2.

Since 5374 is divisible by 2, we can divide it by 2:

5374 ÷ 2 = 2687

We now have the result of the division as 2687. 

Next, we can check if 2687 is divisible by any prime numbers greater than 2. To do this, we can check divisibility up to the square root of 2687, which is approximately 51.83 (rounded up to 52).

We can start checking divisibility by prime numbers greater than 2 in increasing order. 

Checking if 2687 is divisible by 3: 
Sum the digits of 2687: 2 + 6 + 8 + 7 = 23
Since 23 is not divisible by 3, 2687 is not divisible by 3.

Checking if 2687 is divisible by 5: 
The last digit of 2687 is not a 0 or 5, so 2687 is not divisible by 5.

###
To determine if 3279 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of 3279.

The square root of 3279 is approximately 57.23, so we only need to check divisibility by numbers up to 57.

Checking divisibility by prime numbers: 
3279 is not divisible by 2 or 3, as the sum of its digits (3 + 2 + 7 + 9) is not divisible by 3.

Checking divisibility by other numbers up to 57: 
3279 is not divisible by 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53.

Therefore, we can conclude that 3279 is a prime number.
###

###
To determine if 3279 is a composite number, we need to find its factors beyond 1 and itself.

To find the factors, we can start by dividing 3279 by prime numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7...

3279 ÷ 2 = 1639.5 (not a whole number)
3279 ÷ 3 = 1093 (not a whole number)
3279 ÷ 5 = 655.8 (not a whole number)
3279 ÷ 7 = 468.428571 (not a whole number)
3279 ÷ 11 = 298.090909 (not a whole number)
3279 ÷ 13 = 252.230769 (not a whole number)

We can continue dividing by bigger prime numbers, but we can see that none of the divisions result in a whole number. Therefore, 3279 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Since 3279 only has two factors, it is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
###

###
To determine if 4586 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2
Since the last digit of 4586 is 6, which is an even number, we conclude that 4586 is divisible by 2.

Therefore, 4586 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 4586 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether a number is composite or not, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can start by finding the factors of the number. A factor is a whole number that divides evenly into another number. 

For example, for the number 4586, we can check if it is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on up to the square root of 4586. 

If we find any factors, then the number is composite. Otherwise, if we don't find any factors other than 1 and itself, then the number is prime. 

Let's start by checking if 4586 is divisible by 2. 

4586 ÷ 2 = 2293 

Since the result is not a whole number, 4586 is not divisible by 2. 

Next, let's check if it is divisible by 3. 

4586 ÷ 3 = 1528.666... 

Again, the result is not a whole number, so 4586 is not divisible by 3. 

We can continue this process for other numbers, but let's skip ahead to check if 4586 is divisible by 7. 

4586 ÷ 7 = 655.142... 

Once more, the result is not a whole number. 

Considering numbers up to the square root of 4586, which is approximately 67.7, we don't find any factors. 

Therefore, since 4586 doesn't have any factors other than 1 and itself, it is not divisible by any other numbers, and hence, it is a prime number, not a composite number.

No, 3693 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3 and 1231.
###
To determine if 3693 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any prime numbers smaller than its square root.

The square root of 3693 is approximately 60.8 (rounded to the nearest tenth). So, we need to check if 3693 is divisible by any prime numbers from 2 to 60.

Let's start checking:

3693 divided by 2 = 1846 with a remainder of 1.
3693 divided by 3 = 1231 with a remainder of 0.

###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

To check if 3693 is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, we can start by checking if it is divisible by prime numbers less than its square root.

The square root of 3693 is approximately 60.8, so we can start checking divisibility by prime numbers up to 60.

We start by checking if 3693 is divisible by 2. Since it is not an even number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check if it is divisible by 3, which is the next prime number. To do this, we sum the digits of 3693: 3 + 6 + 9 + 3 = 21. Since 21 is not divisible by 3, 3693 is not divisible by 3.

We continue checking divisibility by other prime numbers up to the square root of 3693, but if a number is not divisible by 2 or 3, it is unlikely to be divisible by any other prime number.

Therefore, we can conclude that 3693 is a composite number because it is not divisible by any prime number up to its square root.

We can start by checking if it is divisible by prime numbers 2, 3, 5, and 7. 

9249 is not divisible by 2 because it is an odd number. 

Dividing 9249 by 3 gives a result of 3083 with a remainder of 0. Hence, 9249 is divisible by 3. 

Since 9249 is divisible by 3, we can deduce that it is not a prime number.
###
No, 9249 is not a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to verify if it has factors other than 1 and itself.

To begin, we can find the factors of 9249 by dividing it by each number less than or equal to its square root (since factors always appear in pairs).

The square root of 9249 is approximately 96.11, so we can start by dividing 9249 by 2, then 3, 4, 5, and so on, until we reach 96.

After checking all the possible factors, we find that 9249 is not divisible evenly by any integer other than 1 and itself. Therefore, we can conclude that 9249 is a prime number, not a composite number.

###
To determine if 6662 is a prime number, we need to check whether it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

The first step is to find all the factors of 6662. We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If it is divisible by 2, then it is not a prime number. Otherwise, we continue checking for divisibility by odd numbers up to the square root of 6662.

Dividing 6662 by 2, we get 3331. Since 3331 is a prime number, we can conclude that 6662 is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 6662 is a prime number.

###
Yes.
###
No. 5458 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 5458 is a prime number, we can use the divisibility rules. The divisibility rule for 2 states that a number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even, i.e., 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. In the case of 5458, the last digit is 8, so it is divisible by 2.

Therefore, 5458 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2.
###
Yes, 5458 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can find the factors of the number by dividing it by different numbers and checking for remainders.

Starting with 2, we see that 5458 divided by 2 is 2729 with a remainder of 0.
So, 2 is a factor of 5458.

Next, we try dividing by 3, but 5458 divided by 3 is not a whole number.

Continuing in this manner, we check division by 4, 5, 6, and so on.

After checking all numbers up to the square root of 5458 (approximately 73.8), we find that 5458 is not divisible by any of these numbers.

Therefore, the only factors of 5458 are 1 and 5458.

Since 5458 does not have any other factors, it is not divisible by any other number, and thus it is not a composite number.

Therefore, 5458 is not a composite number.

2. Next, check if any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 3754 divide evenly into 3754.

3. We can start with the smallest prime number, which is 2. Dividing 3754 by 2 gives us a remainder of 0.

4. Therefore, 3754 is divisible by 2 and is not a prime number.

Hence, 3754 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 2.
###
Yes, 3754 is a composite number.
###
Yes, 3754 is a composite number.

To determine whether a number is composite or not, we need to find its factors (numbers that divide it evenly). If a number has more than two factors (1 and itself), then it is composite.

To find the factors of 3754, we can divide it by the numbers from 2 up to the square root of 3754 (approximately 61.27). If any of these numbers divide 3754 evenly, then 3754 is composite.

Dividing 3754 by the numbers from 2 to 61, we find that 2, 11, 29, and 59 divide 3754 evenly. This means that 3754 has more than two factors, making it a composite number.

###
No, 6085 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 5 and 1217.
###
To determine if 6085 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.
First, we can quickly check if it is divisible by 2. If the last digit of a number is even, then the number itself is divisible by 2. The last digit of 6085 is 5, which is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up the digits of 6085: 6 + 0 + 8 + 5 = 19. If the sum of the digits is divisible by 3, then the number itself is divisible by 3. Since 19 is not divisible by 3, neither is 6085.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 5. Again, if the last digit of a number is 0 or 5, then it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit of 6085 is 5, which is not 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Lastly, we can check if it is divisible by 7. There is no quick trick for this like there is for 2, 3, and 5, so we have to use long division. Performing long division on 6085, we find that it is not divisible by 7.

Since none of the previous checks indicated that 6085 is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that 6085 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 6085 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 6085 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can note that 6085 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can try dividing 6085 by 3. The sum of its digits is 6 + 0 + 8 + 5 = 19, which is not divisible by 3. Hence, 6085 is not divisible by 3.

We can also try dividing 6085 by 5. The number does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Next, dividing 6085 by 7, we get a quotient of 869 and a remainder of 2. Since the remainder is not 0, 6085 is not divisible by 7.

Continuing this process with other prime numbers, we find that 6085 is not divisible by 11, 13, 17, and so on.

Since we haven't found any factors of 6085 besides 1 and itself, we can conclude that 6085 is a prime number.

2. Check if 9865 is divisible by any prime numbers up to 99.32 (rounded up to 100). 

Starting with 2, we find that 9865 divided by 2 is not an integer (i.e., it does not give a whole number). 

Moving on to the next prime number, 3, we find that 9865 divided by 3 is also not an integer.

Continuing with prime numbers, we check 9865 divided by 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97. None of these divisions produce an integer.

3. Since we have checked all prime numbers up to 100, and none of them divide 9865 evenly, we can conclude that 9865 is a prime number.

Therefore, 9865 is a prime number.
###
No, 9865 is not a composite number.
###
To determine if 9865 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If the last digit of a number is divisible by 2, then the entire number is divisible by 2. In this case, the last digit of 9865 is odd (5), so it is not divisible by 2. Therefore, we can conclude that 9865 is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check if it is divisible by any odd numbers up to the square root of 9865. The square root of 9865 is approximately 99.32. Therefore, we only need to check odd numbers up to 99.

By checking each odd number from 3 to 99, we find that 9865 is not divisible by any of them. Hence, there are no factors other than 1 and itself, which means that 9865 is a prime number, not a composite number.

Now, we can check if 7679 is divisible by prime numbers less than or equal to 87.69.

Divisibility by 2: 7679 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

Divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of 7679 is 7 + 6 + 7 + 9 = 29. Since 29 is not divisible by 3, 7679 is also not divisible by 3.

Divisibility by 5: 7679 does not end in 0 or 5, which means it is not divisible by 5.

Divisibility by 7: We can try performing a long division to check if 7679 is divisible by 7. Performing the division, we see that 7679 ÷ 7 = 1097. Therefore, 7679 is divisible by 7, and it is not a prime number.

Therefore, 7679 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 7679 is a composite number.

Since none of these numbers divide 6295 evenly, we can conclude that 6295 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 6295 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether a number is composite or not, we have to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can start by checking if 6295 is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of 6295. 

The square root of 6295 is approximately 79.27, so we only need to check divisibility by numbers up to 79. 

If we find any number between 2 and 79 that divides 6295 without leaving a remainder, then it is a factor of 6295 and thus, 6295 is a composite number. 

Let's perform the divisibility test:

6295 ÷ 2 = 3147.5  (not a whole number)
6295 ÷ 3 = 2098.33  (not a whole number)
6295 ÷ 4 = 1573.75  (not a whole number)
.
.
.
6295 ÷ 78 = 80.705  (not a whole number)
6295 ÷ 79 = 79.937  (not a whole number)

Since we have checked all numbers from 2 to 79 and none of them divide 6295 without leaving a remainder, we can conclude that 6295 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 6295 is a prime number and not a composite number.

No, 4535 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 4535 is a prime number, you should apply the steps of prime number testing:

1. Check divisibility by 2:
Since the last digit of 4535 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Check divisibility by 3:
The sum of the digits in 4535 is 4 + 5 + 3 + 5 = 17. Since 17 is not divisible by 3, 4535 is not divisible by 3.

3. Check divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 4535:
√4535 is approximately 67.38. So, you should check if 4535 is divisible by prime numbers up to 67.

Dividing 4535 by prime numbers greater than 3, such as 5 or 7, yields remainders and does not result in an equal division.

Therefore, based on the prime number testing steps, 4535 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 4535 is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has more than two positive divisors. In the case of 4535, its divisors are 1, 5, 907, and 4535, making it a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

To find these factors, we can start dividing the number by integers, starting from 2 up to the square root of the number. If no factors are found, then the number is prime. 

For the number 4535, we start dividing it by 2:

4535 ÷ 2 = 2267.5 

Since 2267.5 is not an integer, 2 is not a factor of 4535.

Next, we divide it by 3:

4535 ÷ 3 = 1511.67 

Again, 1511.67 is not an integer, so 3 is not a factor.

We continue this process, but it is not necessary to go beyond the square root of 4535, which is approximately 67.34. 

After checking all the numbers up to 67, we can conclude that 4535 is a prime number, as no other factors have been found. 

So, 4535 is not a composite number but a prime number.

To determine if 5702 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

Starting with the number 2, we can see that 5702 is not divisible by 2 since the last digit is not even. Next, we try dividing by 3. By finding the sum of the digits, 5 + 7 + 0 + 2 = 14, which is not divisible by 3. 

Now, let's divide by 5. The number 5702 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5. 

Continuing this process, we try dividing by 7. By the divisibility rule of 7, if we double the last digit (2) and subtract it from the remaining truncated number (570), the result should be divisible by 7. 570 - (2 x 2) = 566, which is not divisible by 7. 

After checking for divisibility by primes up to 7, we can conclude that 5702 is not divisible by any prime numbers smaller than its square root (approximately 75.57597). 

Thus, we can safely say that 5702 is a composite number as it has factors other than 1 and itself.

Yes, 9598 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

To check if 9598 is divisible by any number other than 1 and 9598, we can start by checking if it is divisible by 2.

9598 ÷ 2 = 4799

Since 4799 is not a whole number, 9598 is not divisible by 2.

We can then check if it is divisible by 3.

9598 ÷ 3 = 3199.33

Again, 3199.33 is not a whole number, so 9598 is not divisible by 3.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 5.

9598 ÷ 5 = 1919.6

Once again, 1919.6 is not a whole number, so 9598 is not divisible by 5.

The square root of 8315 is approximately 91.17, so we will check divisibility by prime numbers up to 92.

Starting with 2, we divide 8315 by each prime number up to 92. If at any point we find a divisor, then 8315 is not a prime number.

Dividing 8315 by 2 gives us a quotient of 4157.5, which is not a whole number. Therefore, 8315 is not divisible by 2.

Dividing by 3 gives a quotient of 2771.67, which is also not a whole number.

Continuing this process, we find that there is no prime number less than or equal to 92 that divides 8315 without leaving a remainder.

Therefore, we can conclude that 8315 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 8315 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to see if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. 

To check if 8315 is divisible by any numbers, we can start by checking if it's divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 8315 (which is approximately 91.11).

The prime numbers less than or equal to 91 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, and 89.

Checking the divisibility of 8315 by these prime numbers, we find that it is not divisible by any of them. 

Therefore, 8315 is not divisible by any prime numbers and does not have any other factors besides 1 and itself.

Hence, 8315 is a prime number.
###

Yes, 8315 is divisible by 1663.
###
No, 2078 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 2078 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, let's try dividing 2078 by 2: 

2078 ÷ 2 = 1039

Since 1039 is not a whole number, we can conclude that 2078 is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's try dividing 2078 by 3: 

2078 ÷ 3 = 692.666...

Again, we get a non-whole number, so 2078 is not divisible by 3.

Continuing this process, we can try dividing 2078 by subsequent numbers:

2078 ÷ 4 = 519.5
2078 ÷ 5 = 415.6
2078 ÷ 6 = 346.333...
2078 ÷ 7 = 297.142...

And so on. 

We can see that for all the numbers we've tried so far, we obtain non-whole numbers, indicating that 2078 is not divisible by any of them.

However, to be more efficient in checking for divisibility, we can stop checking when we reach the square root of 2078. 

The square root of 2078 ≈ 45.65.

Since we have already checked all the numbers up to 7 and found no divisors, we can conclude that 2078 is a prime number.
###
2078 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

Let's start by finding the factors of 2078:

Factors of 2078:
1, 2, 1039, and 2078.

Since 2078 has factors other than 1 and itself, specifically 2 and 1039, it is a composite number.

###
No, 3134 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2, so it is an even number and not prime.
###
To determine if 3134 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. We can do this by checking divisibility by all prime numbers up to the square root of 3134, which is approximately 55.97.

Starting with 2, we can check if 3134 is divisible by 2. If it is, then 3134 is not prime.

Dividing 3134 by 2 gives us a quotient of 1567. This means that 3134 is divisible by 2.

Therefore, 3134 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 2.
###
Yes, 3134 is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has factors other than 1 and itself. In the case of 3134, it can be factored as 2 × 1567, so it has factors of 2 and 1567 in addition to 1 and itself.
###
To determine whether 3134 is a composite number, we first need to understand the definition of a composite number. 

A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one divisor other than 1 and itself. In other words, if a number has factors other than 1 and itself, then it is composite. 

Now let's analyze the number 3134 to see if it fits the definition of a composite number. 

To begin, we can try dividing 3134 by some small prime numbers such as 2, 3, 5, etc., to check if it is divisible evenly. However, this would require an extensive amount of trial and error. 

Alternatively, we can see that 3134 is even, which means it is divisible by 2. In fact, 3134 divided by 2 results in 1567, which is also an integer. 

Since we have found a factor of 3134 other than 1 and itself (2), we can conclude that 3134 is indeed a composite number.

3957 ÷ 62 ≈ 63.82 (Not divisible)

Since 3957 is not divisible by any numbers between 2 and 62, it is also not divisible by any numbers between 2 and its square root, which is approximately 62.89.

Therefore, we can conclude that 3957 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 3957 is a composite number. It can be factored into 3 × 17 × 77.
###
To determine if 3957 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by dividing 3957 by 2. If it is divisible by 2, then it is composite. Otherwise, we can continue checking for other factors.

3957 divided by 2 equals 1978.5, which is not a whole number. Therefore, 3957 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can try dividing by 3. Again, if it is divisible by 3, then it is composite. Otherwise, we can continue checking for other factors.

3957 divided by 3 equals 1319, which is also not a whole number. Therefore, 3957 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue this process of dividing by prime numbers and checking for whole number results. If at any point we get a whole number as a result, then it means 3957 has a factor other than 1 and itself, making it a composite number.

However, since we have already checked divisibility by 2 and 3, and neither yielded whole number results, we can conclude that 3957 is not divisible by any prime number less than its square root.

Therefore, we can conclude that 3957 is a prime number and not a composite number.

###
To determine if 6395 is a prime number, we can check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root. 

The square root of 6395 is approximately 79.98. 

Starting with 2, we can perform the division: 

6395 ÷ 2 = 3197.5 

As we get a decimal value, we know that 6395 is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we move on to 3: 

6395 ÷ 3 = 2131.666667 

Again, we get a decimal value, so 6395 is not divisible by 3.

###
Yes.
###
No, 1895 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 1895 is a prime number, we first check if it is divisible by 2. As 2 is the only even prime number, any number divisible by 2 cannot be a prime number.

1895 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we check if 1895 is divisible by any odd numbers up to its square root (rounded up to the nearest whole number). In this case, the square root of 1895 is approximately 43.5 (rounded up to 44). 

We can now test if 1895 is divisible by any numbers from 3 to 44. Upon checking, we find that 1895 is not divisible by any of these numbers.

Therefore, we can conclude that 1895 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 1895 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can start by dividing 1895 by all numbers from 2 up to the square root of 1895 (rounded down). 

The square root of 1895 is approximately 43.5 (rounded down to 43). 

Now, let's check if any of the numbers between 2 and 43 divide 1895 evenly:

1895 ÷ 2 = 947.5 (not an integer)
1895 ÷ 3 = 631.666... (not an integer)
1895 ÷ 4 = 473.75 (not an integer)
.
.
.
1895 ÷ 43 = 44.07 (not an integer)

None of the divisions result in an integer value, which means that 1895 is not evenly divisible by any number between 2 and 43.

Since we have checked all the possible factors, and none of them divide 1895 evenly, we can conclude that 1895 is not composite.

Therefore, 1895 is not a composite number.

Yes.
###
No, 9445 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 9445 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if 9445 is divisible by 2. The sum of its digits, 9 + 4 + 4 + 5 = 22, is not divisible by 2, so 9445 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if 9445 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits, 9 + 4 + 4 + 5 = 22, is not divisible by 3, so 9445 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue this process for higher prime numbers, but we can also use a quicker approach. To check if 9445 is divisible by any number, we can check if it is divisible by any prime number less than or equal to the square root of 9445.

The square root of 9445 is approximately 97.16, so we can check divisibility by prime numbers up to 97.

We find that 9445 is divisible by 5, as the last digit is 5, so it is not a prime number.

Therefore, 9445 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 5.

I hope this step-by-step explanation was helpful!
###
Yes, 9445 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 9445 is a composite number, we should first check if it is divisible by any prime numbers. The prime numbers less than the square root of 9445 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17.

If we check if 9445 is divisible by 2, we find that it is not divisible evenly.

Next, we check if 9445 is divisible by 3. Adding up the digits of 9445 (9 + 4 + 4 + 5) results in 22, which is not divisible by 3.

Then, we check if 9445 is divisible by 5. The last digit of 9445 is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Moving on to 7, we can use divisibility rule to check if 9445 is divisible by 7: subtract twice the last digit (2 x 5) from the remaining truncated number (944). This gives us 944 - 2 x 5 = 934. Since 934 is not divisible by 7, 9445 is not divisible by 7.

We continue checking divisibility rules for the remaining prime numbers (11, 13, and 17), but none of them divide evenly into 9445.

Since 9445 is not divisible by any of the prime numbers less than its square root, we can conclude that 9445 is not a composite number.

3505 ÷ 31 = 113 (not divisible)

Step 2: Check if there is a prime factor larger than the square root.
The largest prime number we tested so far is 31. If we continue checking for larger prime numbers, we can see that none of them divides 3505 without a remainder.

Step 3: Determine if 3505 is a prime number.
Since we have exhausted the possible factors up to the square root of 3505 and found no factors, we can conclude that 3505 is indeed a prime number.

Therefore, 3505 is a prime number.

- 2487 is not divisible by 41.
- 2487 is not divisible by 43.
- 2487 is not divisible by 47.

Since we have checked all prime numbers less than the square root of 2487 and found that it is only divisible by 3, we can conclude that 2487 is not a prime number.

Therefore, the answer is no, 2487 is not a prime number.
###

At this point, we can see that there are no further prime factors that divide 2487 evenly. 

Therefore, 2487 is not divisible by any prime numbers other than 1 and itself.

Hence, 2487 is a prime number, not a composite number.
###

###
No, 2855 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 5 and 571.
###
To determine if 2855 is a prime number, let's check if it is divisible by any prime numbers smaller than its square root.

The square root of 2855 is approximately 53.45.

Now, we can check if 2855 is divisible by any prime numbers smaller than 53.

Starting with the smallest prime number, which is 2, we can divide 2855 by 2. If the result is an integer, then 2855 is not a prime number.

2855 divided by 2 equals 1427.5, which is not an integer.

Moving on to the next prime number, which is 3. We can divide 2855 by 3.

2855 divided by 3 equals 951.6667, which is not an integer.

Continuing this process, we can divide 2855 by 5.

2855 divided by 5 equals 571, which is an integer.

Since we were able to divide 2855 by 5 without any remainder, we have found a factor of 2855.

Therefore, 2855 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 2855 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 2855 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

We start by finding the prime factors of 2855. 

The easiest way to do this is to divide 2855 by the smallest prime number (2) repeatedly until it is no longer divisible. 

2855 ÷ 2 = 1427.5 (not a whole number)

Now, we move to the next prime number (3). 

2855 ÷ 3 = 951.67 (not a whole number)

We continue this process, moving to the next prime number, until we find a factor or reach the square root of 2855. 

2855 ÷ 5 = 571 (a whole number)

So, we have found that 5 is a factor of 2855.

###
No, 5294 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2 and 19.
###
To determine if 5294 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can perform a simple divisibility test by dividing 5294 by all integers from 2 to the square root of 5294 (approximately 72.74). 

If at any point the division is exact, i.e., no remainder is left, then 5294 is not a prime number. Otherwise, if no exact division occurs up to the square root of 5294, then 5294 is a prime number. 

Now, let's perform the divisibility test: 

5294 ÷ 2 = 2647 remainder 0 (not a prime number) 

Therefore, 5294 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 2 without any remainder.
###
Yes, 5294 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 5294 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. In this case, 5294 is not divisible by 2 because its units digit is 4, which is not even. 

Next, we can try dividing by 3. By summing the digits of 5294, we have 5 + 2 + 9 + 4 = 20. Since 20 is not divisible by 3, 5294 is also not divisible by 3. 

Now, we can check if 5294 is divisible by any number greater than 3 and less than its square root, which is approximately 72.71. We find that 5294 is divisible by 59, as 59 x 89 = 5261.

###
No, 8553 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3.
###
To determine if 8553 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, let's check if it is divisible by 2. Since 8553 is an odd number (ends with 3), it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we can add all the digits of 8553 together: 8 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 21. Since 21 is divisible by 3, 8553 is also divisible by 3.

Therefore, 8553 is not a prime number since it is divisible by 3.
###
Yes, 8553 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 8553 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Find the factors of 8553
The factors of 8553 are the numbers that divide evenly into 8553. We can use divisibility tests or perform trial division to find the factors.

Starting with the number 2, we can check if it evenly divides 8553. If it does, then 2 is a factor.

8553 ÷ 2 = 4276 remainder 1

Since 2 does not divide evenly into 8553, we can move on to the next number, which is 3.

8553 ÷ 3 = 2851 remainder 0

So, 3 is a factor of 8553.

Step 2: Check for factors beyond 3
We can continue with trial division or use a more efficient method, such as checking divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 8553. However, since we have already found a factor of 3, we know that 8553 is not a prime number.

Therefore, 8553 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.

###
No
###
No, 3455 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if a number is prime, you need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: By looking at the last digit of the number (5), we know that 3455 is not divisible by 2 or 5 since it is not even.

Step 2: To determine if 3455 is divisible by 3, we can add up its digits and check if the sum is divisible by 3. 
3 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 17
Since 17 is not divisible by 3, we know that 3455 is not divisible by 3.

Step 3: Since we've already excluded divisibility by 2, 3, and 5, we can now check divisibility by numbers greater than or equal to 7. 
To check divisibility by 7, we can use the following test: 
Double the last digit (5) and subtract it from the remaining digits (345). 
345 - (2 * 5) = 335
If the result is divisible by 7, then 3455 is divisible by 7. However, if the result is not divisible by 7, then 3455 is not divisible by 7.

Step 4: Let's apply the test for divisibility by 7 to our result from step 3:
Double the last digit (5) and subtract it from the remaining digits (33).
33 - (2 * 5) = 23
Since 23 is not divisible by 7, we can conclude that 3455 is not divisible by 7.

Based on all the steps above, we can confirm that 3455 is a prime number since it is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 3455 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 3455 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 8578 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2.
###
Yes, 8578 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 8578 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Find the square root of 8578. 
√8578 ≈ 92.662489

Step 2: Check for factors starting from 2 up to the square root rounded up to the nearest whole number (93). 

8578 ÷ 2 = 4289
8578 ÷ 3 = 2859.33  (Not a whole number)
8578 ÷ 4 = 2144.5   (Not a whole number)
.
.
8578 ÷ 92 = 93.326  (Not a whole number)

   - 6238 is not divisible by 2 (since it is not even).
   - The sum of its digits is 6 + 2 + 3 + 8 = 19, which is not divisible by 3.
   - The last digit is 8, so it is not divisible by 5.
   - It is not divisible by 7 since this requires subtracting twice the last digit from the remaining digits, 623 - 16 = 607, which is not divisible by 7.

2. Check for divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 6238 (approximately 78.99).

To do this, we can find the prime factorization of 6238.

Start by dividing 6238 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. We find that 6238 divided by 2 is 3119.

Next, divide 3119 by the smallest prime number, which is 17. We find that 3119 divided by 17 is 183.

Since 183 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to its square root, we can stop the division process.

Therefore, the prime factorization of 6238 is 2 x 17 x 183.

Since 6238 can be expressed as the product of prime numbers (2, 17, and 183), it is a composite number.

No, 4078 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2, 2039, and 4078.
###
To determine if 4078 is a prime number, we can begin by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

###
Yes, 4078 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 4078 is a composite number, we need to see if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we check if 2 is a factor of 4078. We divide 4078 by 2, and we get 2039. Since 2039 is not a whole number, 2 is not a factor of 4078.

Next, we check if 3 is a factor of 4078. To do this, we find the sum of the digits of 4078: 4+0+7+8 = 19. Since 19 is not divisible by 3, 3 is not a factor of 4078.

We continue this process for other prime numbers and find that 4078 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 4078 is a prime number.
###

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If the number is even, it is not prime. 

Dividing 1461 by 2, we get a quotient of 730.5. Since the quotient is not a whole number, we can conclude that 1461 is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we need to sum its digits and see if the sum is divisible by 3. 

1 + 4 + 6 + 1 = 12

###
No, it is not divisible by 487.
###
No, 7555 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 5 and 1511.
###
To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

To check if 7555 is prime, we can start by dividing it by 2 and checking if it is divisible:

7555 ÷ 2 = 3777.5

Since the quotient is not a whole number, we can conclude that 7555 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can try dividing it by 3:

7555 ÷ 3 = 2518.33

Again, the quotient is not a whole number, so 7555 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue this process and check division by numbers up to the square root of 7555, which is approximately 86.94.

After checking all the divisions, we conclude that 7555 is not divisible evenly by any number other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 7555 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 7555 is a composite number. It can be factored into the prime factors 5, 7, 11, and 19.
###
To determine if 7555 is a composite number, we need to find its factors. A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has at least one factor other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if 2 is a factor of 7555. We do this by checking if 7555 is divisible by 2 without leaving any remainder. Since 7555 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if 3 is a factor of 7555. We add up the digits of 7555 (7 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 22) and check if the sum is divisible by 3. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, 7555 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue checking other prime numbers as factors, but we don't need to check any number greater than 87 since 87*87 is less than 7555. Also, we can observe that 7555 ends with 5, which means it is divisible by 5.

Therefore, 7555 is a composite number since it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 7555 is divisible by 5.

###
To determine if 4934 is a prime number, we need to test if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check for divisibility by 2.
Since 4934 is an even number (ends with a 4), it is divisible by 2.

Therefore, 4934 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2.
###
Yes, 4934 is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has divisors other than 1 and itself. In the case of 4934, it can be divided by 2 and 7, which are both factors other than 1 and itself (4934).
###
To determine if 4934 is a composite number, we need to check if it can be divided evenly by any number other than 1 and itself.

Let's start by finding the factors of 4934.
The factors of 4934 are:
1, 2, 17, 34, 37, 74, 67, 134, 221, 442, 493, 986, 565, 1130, 9651, 19302

Since 4934 has more than two factors, it is a composite number.
Therefore, 4934 is a composite number.
###

###
Yes
###
No, 1994 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2, 997, and 1994.
###
To determine if 1994 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root (√1994 ≈ 44.65).

Let's check if it is divisible by the prime numbers 2, 3, 5, and 7.

1994 divided by 2 is not a whole number.

1994 divided by 3 is not a whole number.

1994 divided by 5 is not a whole number.

1994 divided by 7 is equal to 285.14, which is not a whole number.

Since 1994 is not divisible by any of these prime numbers, it does not have any divisors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 1994 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 1994 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to check if it has more than two distinct positive divisors. 

To start, we can find the prime factorization of 1994. 

1994 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2. Dividing 1994 by 2 gives us 997. 

Next, let's check if 997 is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root (√997 ≈ 31.6). 

Checking divisibility by prime numbers like 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 results in no exact divisors. 

Therefore, the prime factorization of 1994 is 2 x 997. 

Since 1994 has two distinct positive divisors (1 and itself) and no others, it is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes.
###
No, 9363 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3, 311, and 53.
###
To determine if 9363 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any integer greater than 1 and less than the square root of 9363.

First, we find the square root of 9363. The square root of 9363 is approximately 96.74.

Next, we check the divisibility of 9363 by integers greater than 1 and less than or equal to 96.

Upon checking the divisibility of 9363 by these integers, we find that it is divisible by 3 and 31.

Since 9363 is divisible by integers greater than 1 and less than its square root, it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 9363 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can find the factors of the number. The factors of 9363 are the numbers that divide 9363 without leaving a remainder.

Checking all the numbers up to the square root of 9363 (approximately 96.74), we find that 9363 is divisible by 1, 3, 9, 27, 347, 1041, 3123, and 9363.

Since 9363 has divisors other than 1 and itself, namely 3, 9, 27, 347, 1041, 3123, it is a composite number.
###
Yes
###
Yes.
###
No, 9662 is not a prime number. It can be divided by 2, 4831, 3, 3221, 6, 1611, 7, 1380.
###
To determine if 9662 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any whole number other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. The last digit of 9662 is 2, so it is even and therefore divisible by 2.

Hence, 9662 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2.
###
Yes, 9662 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 9662 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can check if any integers from 2 up to the square root of 9662 divide evenly into 9662.

The square root of 9662 is approximately 98.29.

Now, let's check if 9662 is divisible by any integers from 2 up to 98.

To save time, we can start with 2 and check if 9662 is divisible by it. If it is, then we can conclude that 9662 is a composite number.

However, if none of the integers from 2 up to the square root of 9662 divide evenly into it, then 9662 is a prime number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes
###
No, 1569 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 1569 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit of 1569 is odd (9), it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. By summing the digits (1 + 5 + 6 + 9), we get 21. Since 21 is divisible by 3, we know that 1569 is also divisible by 3.

Therefore, 1569 is not a prime number because it has divisors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 1569 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 1569 is a composite number, we need to first understand what a composite number is. 

A composite number is any positive integer greater than 1 that is not a prime number. In other words, a composite number has factors other than 1 and itself.

To check if 1569 is composite, we need to find its factors. We can do this by dividing 1569 by all the numbers from 2 up to its square root (rounded up to the nearest whole number).

The square root of 1569 is approximately 39.6, so we will check all numbers up to 40.

Dividing 1569 by 2: 1569 ÷ 2 = 784.5.
Since the result is not a whole number, 1569 is not divisible by 2.

Dividing 1569 by 3: 1569 ÷ 3 = 523. 
Again, not a whole number, so 1569 is not divisible by 3.

Continuing in this way, we find that 1569 is not divisible evenly by any number from 2 to 40.

Therefore, 1569 is not a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
No.
###
No, 9098 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 9098 is a prime number, we can try to find any factors of 9098. If we find any factors other than 1 and 9098, then 9098 is not a prime number.

The first step is to find the square root of 9098. The square root of 9098 is approximately 95.5.

Now, let's check if 9098 is divisible by any numbers less than or equal to 95. We can start checking from 2 and go up to 95.

When we divide 9098 by 2, we get a quotient of 4549 with no remainder.

Therefore, 2 is a factor of 9098.

Since we found a factor other than 1 and 9098, we can conclude that 9098 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 9098 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 9098 is a composite number, we need to first understand what a composite number is. 

A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that can be divided evenly (without leaving a remainder) by at least one positive integer other than 1 or itself. In other words, a composite number has more than two distinct positive divisors. 

Now, let's see if 9098 is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

To identify such divisors, we can start dividing 9098 by numbers from 2 to the square root of 9098 and check if any divisions result in an even quotient.

The square root of 9098 is approximately 95.47, so we only need to check the numbers up to 95.

If we divide 9098 by 2, we get a quotient of 4549 with a remainder of 0. 

Therefore, 2 is a divisor of 9098.

Hence, 9098 is a composite number since it has divisors other than 1 and itself.
###

###
6145 is not a prime number.
It is divisible by the following numbers: 5, 7, 11, and 89.
###
To determine if 6145 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

First, we check if it is divisible by 2. Since 6145 is odd, we can conclude that it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (6 + 1 + 4 + 5) is  16, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, we can conclude that 6145 is not divisible by 3.

Now, we check if it is divisible by any prime numbers up to the square root of 6145 (approximately 78.4).

First, we check  if it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit of 6145 is not 0 or 5, we can conclude that it is not divisible by 5.

Next, we check if it is divisible by 7. To do this, we can use the divisibility rule for 7, which states that the alternating sum of the digits of 6145 (6 - 1 + 4 - 5) must be divisible by 7. Since 6 - 1 + 4 - 5 = 4, which is not divisible by 7, we can conclude that 6145 is not divisible by 7.

Since we have checked the prime numbers up to the square root of 6145 and it has not been divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 6145 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 6145 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 6145 is a composite number, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by finding the prime factorization of 6145:

6145 divided by 5 equals 1229.

Therefore, 6145 can be written as 5 × 1229.

Since 1229 is a prime number (it cannot be further divided without getting a decimal), we can conclude that both 5 and 1229 are factors of 6145.

So, 6145 is indeed a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself (5 and 1229).
###
Yes.
###
Yes
###
No, 6638 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2.
###
To determine if 6638 is a prime number, we can check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root. 

The square root of 6638 is approximately 81.5 (rounded to one decimal place). We only need to check divisibility up to the nearest whole number of the square root, which is 81.

Now let's check if 6638 is divisible by prime numbers up to 81. Starting with the smallest prime number, 2, we divide 6638 by 2:

6638 ÷ 2 = 3319

3319 is not a whole number, so 6638 is not divisible by 2. 

Now let's move on to the next prime number, 3:

6638 ÷ 3 = 2212.666...

Again, 2212.666... is not a whole number, so 6638 is not divisible by 3. 

We continue this process with prime numbers up to 81. However, it is clear from the calculations so far that 6638 is not a prime number since it is divisible by more than just 1 and itself (3319). 

Therefore, 6638 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 6638 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 6638 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we should find the prime factorization of 6638. 

The prime factorization of 6638 is calculated as follows:

6638 ÷ 2 = 3319

So, we have found that 6638 is divisible by 2.

Since 3319 is a prime number, we cannot continue factoring.

Therefore, the prime factorization of 6638 is 2 × 3319.

Since 6638 has at least one factor other than 1 and itself, it is a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
No.
###
No, 8278 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 8278 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If it is even and divisible by 2, then it is not a prime number. 

8278 is an even number because it ends with 8 which is divisible by 2. Therefore, it is not a prime number.

8278 is divisible by 2 because 8278 ÷ 2 = 4139. 

Thus, 8278 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 8278 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 8278 is a composite number, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, let's find the prime factors of 8278. We can start dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2:

8278 ÷ 2 = 4139

4139 is not divisible by 2, so we continue with the next prime number, which is 3:

4139 ÷ 3 = 1379

1379 is not divisible by 3 either. Let's move on to the next prime number, which is 5:

1379 ÷ 5 = 275.8

275.8 is not an integer, so 5 is not a factor either. We proceed with the next prime number, which is 7:

1379 ÷ 7 = 197

197 is not divisible by 7. Let's continue with the next prime number, which is 11:

1379 ÷ 11 = 125.3636

125.3636 is not an integer, so 11 is not a factor either. 

As we haven't found any factors other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that 8278 is a prime number, not a composite number.
###

###
Yes
###
6826 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2, 7, and 487.
###
In order to determine if 6826 is a prime number, we can follow a methodical approach.

Firstly, we know that a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, we need to check if 6826 can be divided evenly by any number other than 1 and itself.

Let's start by dividing 6826 by 2:
6826 ÷ 2 = 3413

The result is not a whole number. This means that 6826 is not divisible by 2.

Now, let's try dividing it by 3. We can eliminate this possibility since the sum of its digits (6 + 8 + 2 + 6) equals 22, which is not divisible by 3 without a remainder. Therefore, 6826 is not divisible by 3.

Next, we check divisibility by 5. If the number ends in 0 or 5, it is divisible by 5. Since 6826 does not end with either 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

We can continue this process with other primes, but considering the size of the number, we can conclude that 6826 is not divisible by any prime number less than its square root.

Therefore, after checking all the prime numbers, we can conclude that 6826 is a prime number.

Hence, 6826 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 6826 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 6826 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Find the square root of 6826. 
Taking the square root of 6826 is approximately 82.63. 

Step 2: Check divisibility. 
Starting from 2, we check if 6826 is divisible by any numbers up to its square root.

6826 ÷ 2 = 3413
6826 ÷ 3 = 2275.33 (not divisible without remainder)
6826 ÷ 4 = 1706.5 (not divisible without remainder)
...
6826 ÷ 82.63 ≈ 82.48 (not divisible without remainder)

Since none of the numbers from 2 to 82.63 divide 6826 without remainder, we can conclude that 6826 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 6826 is not a composite number.

###
To determine if 3814 is a prime number, we need to find its factors. We can start by checking if it's divisible by 2, since even numbers are always divisible by 2.

If we divide 3814 by 2, we get 1907. Since 1907 is an odd number, we can move on to the next prime number, which is 3.

When we divide 3814 by 3, we get 1271.67, which is not a whole number. So, 3814 is not divisible by 3.

We continue checking with subsequent prime numbers. Division by 5 gives us 762.8, not a whole number. Division by 7 gives us 544.86, not a whole number. Division by 11 gives us 346.73, not a whole number. Division by 13 gives us 293.38, not a whole number.

At this point, we can conclude that 3814 is not divisible by any prime number up to the square root of 3814. Therefore, it does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

So, we can say that 3814 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 3814 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 3814 is a composite number, let's first check if it is divisible by any whole numbers other than 1 and itself.

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. The last digit of 3814 is 4, so it is an even number, and therefore divisible by 2.

Dividing 3814 by 2, we get 1907 with no remainder. This means that 3814 is divisible by 2.

Since 3814 is divisible by 2, it is a composite number.

The square root of 5403 is approximately 73.54.

Step 2: Check for divisibility by 2.
Since 5403 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Step 3: Check for divisibility by 3.
To check if 5403 is divisible by 3, we can sum its digits: 5 + 4 + 0 + 3 = 12, and then check if 12 is divisible by 3. Since 12 is divisible by 3, 5403 is also divisible by 3.

Step 4: Conclude the divisibility.
Since 5403 is divisible by 3, it means that it is not a prime number.

Therefore, 5403 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 3.
###
Yes, 5403 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 5403 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can find the prime factorization of 5403 by dividing it by prime numbers starting from 2.

5403 ÷ 2 = 2701.5 (not a whole number, so 2 is not a factor)
5403 ÷ 3 = 1801 (not divisible by 3)
5403 ÷ 5 = 1080.6 (not divisible by 5)
5403 ÷ 7 = 771.857 (not divisible by 7)
5403 ÷ 11 = 491.181 (not divisible by 11)
5403 ÷ 13 = 415.615 (not divisible by 13)

At this point, we can stop because we've checked all prime numbers up to the square root of 5403 (approximately 73.5). Since we didn't find any other factors, we can conclude that 5403 is a prime number.

Therefore, 5403 is not a composite number; it is a prime number.

###
No, 7265 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 5 and 1453, in addition to 1 and itself.
###
To determine whether 7265 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. 7265 is not an even number, so it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. By summing the digits of the number, 7 + 2 + 6 + 5 = 20, we see that 7265 is not divisible by 3.

We can also check for divisibility by 5. Since 7265 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Since 7265 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, we can conclude that it is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 7265 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 7265 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 7265 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by finding the prime factorization of 7265. 

Taking the smallest prime number, which is 2, we can see that 7265 is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we try the prime number 3. When we divide 7265 by 3, we get a quotient of 2421 with a remainder of 2. 

Moving on to the next prime number, 5, we find that 7265 is divisible by 5. Dividing 7265 by 5 gives us a quotient of 1453 with no remainder.

Now, we can check if 1453 is divisible by any prime number greater than 5. However, we don't need to check any further because we have already determined that 7265 is divisible by 5.

Therefore, 7265 is a composite number since it is divisible by a number other than 1 and itself.
###
No.
###
Yes
###
No, 1299 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3 and 433.
###
To determine if 1299 is a prime number, we need to check if it's divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Let's start by checking if it's divisible by 2. An integer is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even, which is not the case for 1299 since its last digit is 9.

Next, let's check if it's divisible by 3. We can do this by adding up its digits and checking if the sum is divisible by 3. 1 + 2 + 9 + 9 = 21, and 21 is not divisible by 3. So, 1299 is not divisible by 3.

Continuing to check divisibility, we can skip checking for divisibility by 4, 5, and 6, as 1299 doesn't meet the conditions for divisibility by these numbers.

We can then move on to checking divisibility by 7. To do this, we can double the last digit (9) and subtract it from the remaining part of the number (129). If the result is divisible by 7, then so is the original number. 129 - (2 * 9) = 129 - 18 = 111, which is not divisible by 7.

Since 1299 does not meet the divisibility conditions for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, it is not divisible by any of these numbers.

Therefore, we can conclude that 1299 is a prime number, as it is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 1299 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

To check for factors, we can start dividing the number by smaller numbers and see if there are no remainders. 

In the case of 1299, we begin by dividing it by 2:

1299 ÷ 2 = 649.5

Since 649.5 is not a whole number, 2 is not a factor of 1299. 

Next, we try dividing by 3:

1299 ÷ 3 = 433

Since 433 is a whole number, 3 is a factor of 1299.

So, we can confirm that 1299 is a composite number since it has factors other than 1 and itself.

2. Check for divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of 1939 is 1 + 9 + 3 + 9 = 22. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, 1939 is also not divisible by 3.

3. Check for divisibility by other primes up to the square root of 1939: √1939 ≈ 44.05. 

We can check if 1939 is divisible by any primes up to 44:

- It is not divisible by 31 (1939 ÷ 31 = 62 with a remainder).
- It is not divisible by 37 (1939 ÷ 37 = 52 with a remainder).
- It is not divisible by 41 (1939 ÷ 41 = 47 with a remainder).
- It is not divisible by 43 (1939 ÷ 43 = 45 with a remainder).

Since we have checked all possible divisors up to the square root of 1939 and have not found any exact divisors, we can conclude that 1939 is a prime number.

Let's try dividing 1939 by prime numbers:

1939 ÷ 2 = 969.5 (not a whole number)
1939 ÷ 3 = 646.33 (not a whole number)
1939 ÷ 5 = 387.8 (not a whole number)
1939 ÷ 7 = 277 (whole number)

We found a whole number divisor: 1939 ÷ 7 = 277. This means that 1939 is divisible by 7, so it is a composite number.

Therefore, 1939 is a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
No, 1939 is not divisible by 277.
###
No, 4227 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 19 and 223.
###
To determine if 4227 is a prime number, we can check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check divisibility by 2. Since 4227 is an odd number (ends in 7), it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check divisibility by 3. The sum of the digits of 4227 is 4 + 2 + 2 + 7 = 15, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 4227 is divisible by 3.

Hence, 4227 is not a prime number since it is divisible by 3.
###
Yes, 4227 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 4227 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can check if any numbers less than the square root of 4227 divide it evenly.

The square root of 4227 is approximately 65.03.

Starting from 2, we can check if any numbers evenly divide 4227, up to 65.

Upon checking, we find that 4227 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 4227 is not a composite number but rather a prime number.

###
To determine if 4918 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.
First, let's write down the factors of 4918:

1 x 4918 = 4918
2 x 2459 = 4918
13 x 379 = 4918
26 x 189 = 4918
38 x 129 = 4918
78 x 63 = 4918
In each factorization, we can see that 4918 has factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 4918 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 4918 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Find the factors of 4918.
We can start by checking numbers smaller than or equal to the square root of 4918. So, let's find the square root of 4918.

√4918 ≈ 70.11

Checking for factors up to 70, we find that 4918 is divisible by 2, 7, 14, and 67. 

Step 2: Determine if any of these factors, other than 1 and itself, exist.
We do have factors other than 1 and 4918 - 2, 7, 14, and 67.

Therefore, 4918 is a composite number.
###

###
Yes.
###
No, 9166 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 9166 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

First, we'll check if 9166 is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is not a prime number because it has at least three divisors: 1, 2, and itself.

9166 divided by 2 equals 4583. Therefore, 9166 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we'll check if it's divisible by 3. 

Adding the digits of 9166: 9 + 1 + 6 + 6 = 22. 
Since 22 is not divisible by 3, then 9166 is not divisible by 3 either.

Proceeding to check if it's divisible by 5. We know that a number is divisible by 5 if the last digit is 0 or 5. However, the last digit of 9166 is 6, so it is not divisible by 5.

Finally, we can check if it's divisible by 7. 

Apply the rule of divisibility by 7, we subtract twice the last digit from the number formed by the remaining digits:  
91 - (2 × 6) = 79. 

Since 79 is not divisible by 7, then 9166 is not divisible by 7 either.

Therefore, 9166 has no divisors other than 1 and itself, making it a prime number.
###
Yes, 9166 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether a number is composite or not, we need to check if it has a factor other than 1 and itself.

1 x 2045 = 2045
5 x 409 = 2045
7 x 293 = 2045
13 x 157 = 2045

5386 is an even number, as it ends in 6. Therefore, it is divisible by 2. Thus, 5386 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 5386 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 5386 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors besides 1 and itself. 

First, we find the square root of 5386, which is approximately 73.42. 

Next, we check for any factors of 5386 by testing division with numbers up to its square root.

Testing division by 2: 5386 ÷ 2 = 2693 (not a whole number)
Testing division by 3: 5386 ÷ 3 = 1795.33 (not a whole number)
Testing division by 4: 5386 ÷ 4 = 1346.5 (not a whole number)
Testing division by 5: 5386 ÷ 5 = 1077.2 (not a whole number)

We continue testing division up to the square root value of 5386:

Testing division by 6: 5386 ÷ 6 = 897.67 (not a whole number)
Testing division by 7: 5386 ÷ 7 = 769.43 (not a whole number)
Testing division by 8: 5386 ÷ 8 = 673.25 (not a whole number)
Testing division by 9: 5386 ÷ 9 = 598.44 (not a whole number)

To determine whether 2446 is a prime number, we can use a few different methods. 

One method is to check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to its square root (approximated to the nearest whole number). 

Since the square root of 2446 is approximately 49.5, we only need to check divisibility by prime numbers up to 49. 

We can start by checking divisibility by 2. Since 2446 is even, it is divisible by 2. 

Therefore, 2446 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2.
###
Yes, 2446 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether 2446 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

We can start by checking for divisible by 2, since it is even. Dividing 2446 by 2 gives us 1223, which is not a whole number. Therefore, 2446 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check for divisibility by 3. Adding the digits of 2446 (2 + 4 + 4 + 6) gives us 16. Dividing 16 by 3 gives us a remainder of 1. Therefore, 2446 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue checking for divisibility by other numbers, but it is sufficient to conclude that 2446 is a composite number as it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 2446 is divisible by 2.
###
Yes
###
No, 3453 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3 and 1151.
###
To determine if 3453 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we need to check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit of 3453 is odd, we can conclude that it is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check if it is divisible by 3. Adding up the digits of 3453, we get 3 + 4 + 5 + 3 = 15. Since 15 is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 3453 is divisible by 3.

Thus, we can conclude that 3453 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 3.
###
Yes, 3453 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 3453 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.
We can start by checking if 3453 is divisible by 2. To do this, we check if the last digit of 3453 (which is 3) is divisible by 2. Since 3 is not divisible by 2, we can conclude that 3453 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if 3453 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up the digits of 3453: 3 + 4 + 5 + 3 = 15. Since 15 is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 3453 is divisible by 3.

Therefore, 3453 is a composite number, as it has divisors other than 1 and itself (in this case, 3 and 1151 are divisors of 3453).
###
Yes, 3453 is divisible by 3.
###
Yes.
###
Yes, 5173 is a prime number.
###
To determine whether 5173 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check divisibility by 2. Since 5173 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can move on to check divisibility by other prime numbers.

Next, we can check divisibility by 3. Summing the digits of 5173 (5 + 1 + 7 + 3 = 16), we find that 16 is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 5173 is not divisible by 3.

We continue this process and check divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 5173 (approximately 71.92). 

Checking divisibility by 5, we see that 5173 does not end in either 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Next, we check divisibility by 7. Subtracting twice the last digit (3) from the remaining digits (517) gives us 517 - 2(3) = 511. Since 511 is not divisible by 7, 5173 is not divisible by 7.

Checking divisibility by 11, we subtract three times the last digit (3) from the remaining digits (517) to get 517 - 3(3) = 508. Since 508 is not divisible by 11, 5173 is not divisible by 11.

Continuing this process for each prime number up to the square root of 5173, we find that 5173 is not divisible by any of them.

Therefore, we conclude that 5173 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 5173 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 5173 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can find the factors of 5173 by checking all numbers up to the square root of 5173 (approximately 71.96). 

We can divide 5173 by all numbers from 2 to 71 and check if any of them divide evenly without leaving a remainder. If we find any such factors, then we know that 5173 is a composite number. If we don't find any factors other than 1 and itself, then 5173 is a prime number.

By performing the calculations, we find that 5173 is not divisible by any numbers from 2 to 71. Therefore, it does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. 

Hence, 5173 is a prime number and not a composite number.
###
Yes, 5173 is not divisible by 7.

√7231 ≈ 85.057

Now, we can check if 7231 is divisible by any prime numbers between 2 and 85.

Yes
###
No, 1822 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 1822 is a prime number, we will check if it is divisible by any prime numbers from 2 up to its square root.

First, we check if 1822 is divisible by 2. The last digit of 1822 is even, which means it is divisible by 2.

1822 ÷ 2 = 911

911 is an odd number, so we continue to check if it is divisible by any other prime numbers.

Next, we check if 911 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits is 9 + 1 + 1 = 11, which is not divisible by 3.

Next, we check if 911 is divisible by 5. The last digit of 911 is not a 0 or a 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Next, we check if 911 is divisible by 7. There is no obvious pattern or divisibility rule, so we can divide it manually to check if it evenly divides.

911 ÷ 7 = 130 remainder 1

Since 911 leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 7, it is not divisible by 7.

Next, we check if 911 is divisible by 11. The difference between the sum of the forward digits and the sum of the backward digits is 11 - 1 = 10. Since 10 is not divisible by 11, 911 is not divisible by 11.

Since we have checked prime numbers up to the square root of 911 (which is approximately 30), and 911 is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 911 is a prime number.

Therefore, 1822 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 1822 is a composite number. It can be factored as 2 x 911.
###
To determine if 1822 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by finding the square root of 1822, which is approximately 42.68. 

Next, we can check if 1822 is divisible by any numbers from 2 to 42. Since it is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, or 41, we can conclude that 1822 is not divisible by any numbers between 2 and 42.

Thus, we can deduce that the number 1822 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself, making it a prime number, not a composite number.
###

###
Yes
###
No, 8187 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3 and 2729, among other factors.
###
To determine if 8187 is a prime number, we can follow these steps:

1. Check if 8187 is divisible by 2. Since 8187 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Check if 8187 is divisible by any odd number greater than 2 and less than or equal to the square root of 8187. 

To find the square root of 8187, we can use a calculator or estimate it to be around 90.

Now, let's try dividing 8187 by odd numbers less than or equal to 90.

8187 ÷ 3 = 2729 (not divisible)
8187 ÷ 5 = 1637.4 (not divisible)
8187 ÷ 7 = 1169.6 (not divisible)
8187 ÷ 9 = 909 (not divisible)
8187 ÷ 11 = 744.27 (not divisible)
8187 ÷ 13 = 629.77 (not divisible)
8187 ÷ 15 = 545.8 (not divisible)
...
8187 ÷ 89 = 92.16 (not divisible)
8187 ÷ 90 = 91.07 (not divisible)

3. Since we have checked all the odd numbers less than or equal to the square root of 8187 and none of them divided evenly into 8187, we can conclude that 8187 is a prime number.

Therefore, 8187 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 8187 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 8187 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Now, the first step is to find the factors of 8187:

8187 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

We can perform a quick divisibility test for 3 by checking if the sum of the digits of 8187 is divisible by 3:

8 + 1 + 8 + 7 = 24

Since 24 is divisible by 3, we know that 8187 is divisible by 3.

8187 ÷ 3 = 2729

So, we have found one factor: 3.

Now, let's check if 8187 is divisible by any numbers between 3 and the square root of 8187. We can stop at the square root because any factors after that will already have corresponding factors below the square root.

The square root of 8187 is approximately 90.5.

We can start testing for divisibility by checking the prime numbers up to the square root of 8187:

5: 8187 is not divisible by 5.
7: 8187 is not divisible by 7.
11: 8187 is not divisible by 11.
13: 8187 is not divisible by 13.
17: 8187 is not divisible by 17.
19: 8187 is not divisible by 19.
23: 8187 is not divisible by 23.

We can see that we haven't found any more factors for 8187.

Therefore, we conclude that 8187 is a composite number since it has factors other than 1 and itself. In this case, the factor we found is 3.
###
Yes.
###
Yes, 8187 is divisible by 2729 with a quotient of 3.
###
No, 4358 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 4358 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.
The square root of 4358 is approximately 65.98, so we only need to check divisibility by prime numbers up to 65.

We can check if 4358 is divisible by prime numbers 2, 3, 5, and so on, up to 65.

Starting with 2: 4358 % 2 = 0 (The remainder is zero), so 4358 is divisible by 2 and is therefore not a prime number.

Therefore, 4358 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 4358 is a composite number. A composite number is any positive integer that has divisors other than 1 and itself. In this case, 4358 can be divided evenly by 2, 2179, 11, and 397. Therefore, it is a composite number.
###
To determine whether a number is composite or not, we need to first understand the definition of a composite number.

A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or the number itself. In other words, a composite number has factors other than 1 and itself.

To check if the number 4358 is composite, we need to test if it has any divisors other than 1 and 4358.

Starting with the divisors of 2, we can see that 4358 is even because its units digit is even (8). So, 2 is a divisor of 4358.

To further investigate if there are any more divisors, we can perform a prime factorization of the number. 

Dividing 4358 by 2, we get 2179. 

Now, we continue to factorize 2179. Dividing it by 2 and all other primes, we find that there are no more factors.

Therefore, we conclude that 4358 is a composite number, as it has divisors other than 1 and the number itself.
###
Yes.
###
Yes
###
No, 4702 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2 and 2351.
###
To determine whether 4702 is a prime number or not, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we can eliminate divisibility by 2 because 4702 is an even number (it ends with a 2).

Next, we can try dividing it by prime numbers up to its square root (√4702 ≈ 68.59). 
If 4702 is divisible evenly by any number larger than 2 and smaller than its square root, then it is not a prime number.

Let's check divisibility by prime numbers up to 68:

- 4702 ÷ 3 = 1567.33 (not divisible)
- 4702 ÷ 5 = 940.4 (not divisible)
- 4702 ÷ 7 = 671.71 (not divisible)
- 4702 ÷ 11 = 427.45 (not divisible)
- 4702 ÷ 13 = 361.69 (not divisible)
- 4702 ÷ 17 = 276.59 (not divisible)
... and so on.

We continue this process until we reach the square root of 4702 or we find a factor.

Since no prime numbers up to 68 divide 4702 evenly, we can conclude that 4702 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 4702 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 4702 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can begin by finding the square root of 4702, which is approximately 68.53. 

Next, we can test all numbers up to 68 to see if any of them divide evenly into 4702.

If we find any factors, then 4702 is a composite number. However, if we don't find any factors other than 1 and 4702, then it is a prime number.

Performing the test, we find that 4702 can be divided evenly by 2, 11, 19, 47, 94, 209, 361, and 4702 itself. 

Since 4702 has factors other than 1 and itself, it is a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
No.
###
No, 2746 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2, 137, and 19.
###
To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. We can do this by trying to divide it by all numbers from 2 to the square root of the number. 

For 2746, the square root is approximately 52.42. So we only need to check divisibility up to 52. 

Starting with 2, we try dividing 2746 by each number up to 52 to see if any division results in a whole number. 

Upon checking, we find that 2746 is divisible by 2 and 137. Since it has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 2746 is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has factors other than 1 and itself. In the case of 2746, it can be factored into 2 and 1377.
###
To determine if 2746 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 
First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If a number ends in an even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, 8), it is divisible by 2. Since 2746 ends in 6, it is divisible by 2. 
Dividing 2746 by 2 gives us 1373, which is not a whole number. 
Since it is not divisible by 2, we can check if it is divisible by any other numbers. 
It is not divisible by 3 or 5, as their sums of digits do not result in a multiple of 3 or 5, respectively. 
Next, we can check if it is divisible by 7. 
Using the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the units digit (6) from the remaining number (274), giving us 274 - (2*6) = 262. 
Since 262 is not divisible by 7, we move on to other numbers. 
It is not divisible by 11 or 13 either. 
Hence, we can conclude that 2746 is a prime number since it does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

###
No, 1318 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2, 659, and itself (1318).
###
To determine if 1318 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

The square root of 1318 is approximately 36.28. We will check if 1318 is divisible by any prime numbers less than 37.

We can start with 2. 1318 is even, so it is divisible by 2.

1318 / 2 = 659.

659 is not divisible by 3 or 5.

Next, we check for divisibility by primes greater than 5 but less than 37. 

1318 is not divisible by 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, or 37.

Therefore, 1318 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

Since we have not found any factors other than 1 and 1318, we can conclude that 1318 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 1318 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 1318 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Let's factorize 1318:

1318 = 2 × 659

Since 1318 has factors other than 1 and itself (2 and 659), it is a composite number.
###
Yes, 1318 is divisible by 2.
###
Yes
###
No, 3194 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 2 and 1597.
###
To determine if 3194 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we check if 3194 is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is not a prime number.

3194 divided by 2 is 1597 with a remainder of 0.

Since 3194 is divisible by 2, it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 3194 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 3194 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if 2 is a factor of 3194. We can do this by dividing 3194 by 2 and checking if the result is an integer. Performing the division 3194 / 2 gives us 1597. Since 1597 is not an integer, we can conclude that 2 is not a factor of 3194.

Next, we can check if 3 is a factor. Dividing 3194 by 3 gives us 1064.6667, which is not an integer. Therefore, 3 is also not a factor of 3194.

We can continue this process and check other primes such as 5, 7, 11, etc. However, it is not necessary to continue checking higher primes since we have already determined that 3194 is not divisible evenly by 2 or 3. 

Therefore, we can conclude that 3194 is not a composite number.
###
Yes
###
No.
###
No, 3545 is not a prime number.
###
To check if 3545 is a prime number, we need to determine if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2
Since the last digit is 5, the number is odd and not divisible by 2.

Step 2: Check divisibility by 3
To check if a number is divisible by 3, we need to find the sum of its digits and check if that sum is divisible by 3. 
In this case, 3 + 5 + 4 + 5 = 17, which is not divisible by 3.

Step 3: Check divisibility by other primes
We do not need to check divisibility by every prime number. We can stop after checking divisibility by primes less than or equal to the square root of the number.

Step 4: Check divisibility by primes less than or equal to the square root of 3545
The square root of 3545 is approximately 59.46. We only need to check divisibility by primes less than or equal to 59.

Checking divisibility by 5: Since the last digit is 5, the number is not divisible by 5.

Checking divisibility by 7: We can skip checking divisibility by 7 for now, as it is not necessary based on the given steps.

Step 5: Conclusion
After checking divisibility by primes less than or equal to 59, we have determined that 3545 is not divisible by any of those primes. Therefore, 3545 does not have any divisors other than 1 and itself, making it a prime number.

So, 3545 is a prime number.
###
Yes.
###
To determine if 3545 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, let's find the prime factors of 3545. We can start by dividing it by 2 (the smallest prime number). If it is divisible by 2, it is not a prime number and is therefore composite.

3545 divided by 2 is not a whole number, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can try dividing it by 3. If it is divisible by 3, it is composite.

To check if 3545 is divisible by 3, we can add up its digits: 3 + 5 + 4 + 5 = 17. Since 17 is not divisible by 3, 3545 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue this process by checking divisibility with prime numbers greater than 3, but we can stop here because if a number is not divisible by 2 or 3, it won't be divisible by any higher prime numbers.

In conclusion, since 3545 is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself, it is a prime number and not composite.
###

###
Yes
###
No, 4449 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 4449 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any integer greater than 1 but less than its square root.

First, we find the square root of 4449, which is approximately 66.703. 

Then, we check if 4449 is divisible by any integer greater than 1 but less than 67.

Proceeding with the calculations, we find that 4449 is divisible by 3 since 4449 ÷ 3 = 1483.

Therefore, 4449 is not a prime number since it is divisible by an integer other than 1 and itself.
###

4449 ÷ 2 = 2224 remainder 1

Next, we can try dividing by 3:
4449 ÷ 3 = 1483 remainder 0

We have found a factor. So, 3 is a prime factor of 4449.

Now we can divide 4449 by 3:
1483 ÷ 3 = 494 remainder 1

Next, we can try dividing by 5:
1483 ÷ 5 = 296 remainder 3

Again, we have found a factor. So, 5 is a prime factor of 4449.

Continuing in this way, we can see that 7 is also a prime factor of 4449.

Since 4449 has prime factors other than 1 and itself (3, 5, and 7), we conclude that 4449 is indeed a composite number.

###
Yes, 7235 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 7235 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If the number ends in an even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), it is divisible by 2. Since 7235 ends in 5, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 7235 is 7 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 17, which is not divisible by 3.

Then, we can check if it is divisible by 5. As mentioned earlier, if the number ends in 5 or 0, then it is divisible by 5. Since 7235 ends in 5, it is divisible by 5.

Therefore, 7235 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 5.
###
Yes, 7235 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 7235 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Let's find the divisors of 7235.

Firstly, we can check if it is divisible by 2. However, 7235 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (7 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 17) is not divisible by 3, so 7235 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue this process for other prime numbers, such as 5, 7, 11, etc., but it is unnecessary because the largest prime number less than the square root of 7235 is 83. Therefore, if 7235 is not divisible by any number less than or equal to 83, then it is a prime number.

After checking all the numbers up to 83, we have determined that 7235 is not divisible by any of them.

Therefore, 7235 is a prime number, not a composite number.

###
No, 5965 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 5 and 1193.
###
To determine if 5965 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to its square root.

The square root of 5965 is approximately 77.24, so we only need to check divisibility by prime numbers up to 77.

Let's go through the prime numbers up to 77 and check if any of them divide 5965:

2 does not divide 5965.
3 does not divide 5965.
5 does not divide 5965.
7 divides 5965 evenly. (5965 ÷ 7 = 852)

Since 7 divides 5965 evenly, 5965 is not a prime number.

Therefore, 5965 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 5965 is a composite number because it can be evenly divided by numbers other than 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 5965 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To start, let's find the prime factorization of 5965. We can do this by dividing it by prime numbers until we reach 1.

5965 divided by 2 is not a whole number.

5965 divided by 3 is not a whole number.

5965 divided by 4 is not a whole number.

5965 divided by 5 equals 1193, which is a whole number.

###
No, 6995 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 5 and 139.
###
To determine whether 6995 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we check if it is divisible by 2. Since 6995 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can move on to the next prime number, which is 3.

To check if 6995 is divisible by 3, we sum its digits: 6 + 9 + 9 + 5 = 29. Since 29 is not divisible by 3, 6995 is also not divisible by 3.

Next, we check if it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit of 6995 is 5, it is divisible by 5.

Therefore, 6995 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 5.
###
Yes, 6995 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to understand the definition of a composite number. A composite number is any positive integer greater than 1 that is not a prime number. 

To check if 6995 is composite, we need to find its factors. We can start by dividing it by smaller prime numbers, such as 2, 3, 5, and 7.

6995 is not divisible by 2, as it is an odd number. 

To check if it is divisible by 3, we can add up its digits and see if the sum is divisible by 3. In this case, 6 + 9 + 9 + 5 = 29, which is not divisible by 3. 

If it is divisible by 5, it should end in 0 or 5, which is not the case for 6995. 

6995 is not divisible by 7 either.

Since we have checked several prime numbers without finding a divisor, we can conclude that 6995 is not divisible by any prime numbers up to its square root (which is approximately 83.63).

Therefore, we can conclude that 6995 is a prime number and not composite.

###
No, 8407 is not a prime number. It can be factored as 7 × 1201.
###
To determine if 8407 is a prime number, we can start by checking its divisibility by prime numbers less than its square root.

First, we can check if 8407 is divisible by 2. The last digit of 8407 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if 8407 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits, 8+4+0+7, is 19, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 8407 is not divisible by 3.

Now, let's check if 8407 is divisible by 5. The last digit of 8407 is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Since 8407 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, we can continue checking divisibility until the square root of 8407. The square root of 8407 is approximately 91.68.

Now, we can check divisibility by prime numbers from 7 to 91. 8407 is not divisible by 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 91.

Since we have checked all prime numbers less than the square root of 8407, and 8407 is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 8407 is a prime number.

Therefore, 8407 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 8407 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 8407 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. We can check this by dividing 8407 by all the numbers from 2 up to the square root of 8407 (rounded up to the nearest whole number).

The square root of 8407 is approximately 91.7, so we only need to check divisibility up to 91.

By dividing 8407 by all the numbers from 2 to 91, we find that it is not divisible by any of these numbers without leaving a remainder.

Therefore, 8407 has no factors other than 1 and itself, making it a prime number rather than a composite number.
###

###
Yes, 5637 is a prime number.
###
To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Let's check if 5637 is divisible by any number less than its square root (√5637).

Calculating the square root of 5637 gives us approximately 75.01 (rounded to two decimal places).

Now, let's check the divisibility of 5637 by all the whole numbers from 2 to 75.

Starting with 2, we find that 5637 is not divisible by 2. Proceeding to 3, we find that 5637 is not divisible by 3 either. 

Continuing the process, we check for divisibility by 4, 5, 6, and so on, until we reach 75. 

Upon reaching 75, we find that 5637 is not divisible by it either.

Since there are no divisors other than 1 and the number itself, we can conclude that 5637 is a prime number.

Therefore, yes, 5637 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 5637 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 5637 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we observe that 5637 is an odd number. Composite numbers can be odd or even, so this information does not help us determine its nature.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root (rounded up). The square root of 5637 is approximately 75.07.

Starting with the smallest prime number, 2, we find that 5637 is not divisible by 2. 
We move on to the next prime number, 3. If we sum the digits of 5637, we get 5+6+3+7 = 21. Since 21 is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 5637 is also divisible by 3.

Further dividing 5637 by 3, we get 5637 ÷ 3 = 1879, which is not a prime number but rather a whole number greater than 1.

As a result, 5637 is indeed a composite number since it has factors other than 1 and itself (3 and 1879).

Since the last digit of 2798 is even (i.e., 8), it is divisible by 2.

Therefore, 2798 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 2798 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 2798 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Find the factors of 2798

To find the factors of 2798, we can start by dividing it by 2, as it is an even number.

2798 ÷ 2 = 1399

As the result is not a whole number, 2 is not a factor of 2798. So, we continue by trying the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

2798 ÷ 3 ≈ 933 (not a whole number)

Now, let's try dividing by 5.

2798 ÷ 5 ≈ 559.6 (not a whole number)

Observing the pattern, we notice that the number ends with 8, which is divisible by 2. So, let's try dividing by 2 again.

2798 ÷ 2 = 1399

This time, the result is a whole number. Therefore, we have found a factor: 2.

Step 2: Check for any additional factors

Now that we have found one factor, 2, let's continue dividing 1399 to check for any additional factors.

1399 ÷ 2 ≈ 699.5 (not a whole number)

1399 ÷ 3 ≈ 466.3 (not a whole number)

1399 ÷ 5 ≈ 279.8 (not a whole number)

1399 ÷ 7 ≈ 199.9 (not a whole number)

1399 ÷ 11 ≈ 127.2 (not a whole number)

1399 ÷ 13 ≈ 107.6 (not a whole number)

1399 ÷ 17 ≈ 82.3 (not a whole number)

1399 ÷ 19 ≈ 73.6 (not a whole number)

1399 ÷ 23 ≈ 60.9 (not a whole number)

1399 ÷ 29 ≈ 48.3 (not a whole number)

1399 ÷ 31 ≈ 45.1 (not a whole number)

1399 ÷ 37 ≈ 37.8 (not a whole number)

1399 ÷ 41 ≈ 34.1 (not a whole number)

1399 ÷ 43 ≈ 32.5 (not a whole number)

1399 ÷ 47 ≈ 29.8 (not a whole number)

1399 ÷ 53 ≈ 26.4 (not a whole number)

1399 ÷ 59 ≈ 23.7 (not a whole number)

1399 ÷ 61 ≈ 22.9 (not a whole number)

As we can see, none of the divisions resulted in a whole number, so there are no additional factors.

Step 3: Conclude

Since 2798 has factors other than 1 and itself (namely, 2), it is a composite number.

###
No, 7041 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 23 and 307.
###
To determine if 7041 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to its square root.

The square root of 7041 is approximately 83.92 (rounded to two decimal places).

Now, we can check if any prime numbers less than or equal to 83.92 divide 7041.

Starting with the smallest prime number, 2, we see that 7041 ÷ 2 = 3520.5, which is not an integer. Hence, 2 does not divide 7041.

Next, we check with the prime number 3. 7041 ÷ 3 = 2347, which is not an integer. Therefore, 3 does not divide 7041.

Moving on to the next prime number 5, 7041 ÷ 5 = 1408.2, which is not an integer. Therefore, 5 does not divide 7041.

Continuing this process, we check with the prime number 7. 7041 ÷ 7 = 1005.8571428571429, which is not an integer. Thus, 7 does not divide 7041.

We keep checking with prime numbers in ascending order (11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83), but none of them divide 7041 evenly.

Since we have checked all the prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 7041 without finding any that divide it evenly, we can conclude that 7041 is a prime number.

Therefore, 7041 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 7041 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 7041 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 7041 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any prime numbers up to its square root, which is approximately 83.9. 

Dividing 7041 by prime numbers such as 3, 5, 7, 11, etc., we find that none of these numbers evenly divide into 7041. 

Therefore, we can conclude that 7041 has no factors other than 1 and itself.

Let's start by checking if 8751 is divisible by 2:

8751 ÷ 2 = 4375.5

Since the result is not a whole number, we can conclude that 8751 is not divisible by 2. 

Next, let's check if 8751 is divisible by 3:

8751 ÷ 3 = 2917

Again, the result is not a whole number, so 8751 is not divisible by 3. 

Now we can proceed to check if 8751 is divisible by 5:

8751 ÷ 5 = 1750.2

Since the result is not a whole number, 8751 is not divisible by 5. 

Lastly, we check if 8751 is divisible by 7:

8751 ÷ 7 = 1250.142857142857

Once again, the result is not a whole number, so 8751 is not divisible by 7.

Since we have checked all prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 8751 without finding any divisors, we can conclude that 8751 is a prime number.
###

Now, we can check all the numbers from 2 to 93 to see if any of them divide 8751 evenly. 

Upon checking, we find that the factors of 8751 are 3, 29, and 101. Since 8751 has factors other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number. 

Therefore, 8751 is a composite number.

###
To determine if 3831 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can divide 3831 by several numbers. If we find any factors, then 3831 is a composite number. If we don't find any factors other than 1 and itself, then 3831 is a prime number.

Let's start by dividing 3831 by 2.
3831 ÷ 2 = 1915 (Not an exact division)

Next, we try dividing 3831 by 3.
3831 ÷ 3 = 1277 (Not an exact division)

We continue by trying 3831 divided by 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9... All the way up to the square root of 3831. 

However, at this point, we can see that 3831 does not divide exactly by any of these values, and we have reached the square root of 3831. 

Therefore, we can conclude that 3831 is a prime number since it does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Yes, 3831 is divisible by 3.
###
Yes.
###
No, 1385 is not a prime number. It can be divisible by 5 and 277, in addition to 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 1385 is a prime number, we need to test if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can start by checking if 1385 is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is not a prime number.

Indeed, 1385 is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if 1385 is divisible by 3. If it is, then it is not a prime number.

Adding up the digits of 1385, we get 1 + 3 + 8 + 5 = 17, which is not divisible by 3. 

Moving on, we can check if 1385 is divisible by 5. If it is, then it is not a prime number.

Again, 1385 is not divisible by 5. 

Next, we can check if 1385 is divisible by 7. If it is, then it is not a prime number.

When we divide 1385 by 7, we get a remainder of 0. Therefore, 1385 is divisible by 7, which means it is not a prime number. 

So, in conclusion, 1385 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 7.
###
Yes, 1385 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 1385 is a composite number, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If it is, then it would have factors other than 1 and itself, making it a composite number. If it is not divisible by 2, we can continue checking other divisors. 

In this case, 1385 is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. If it is, then it would also have factors other than 1 and itself. 

To check if it is divisible by 3, we can sum its digits: 1 + 3 + 8 + 5 = 17. 17 is not divisible by 3, so 1385 is not divisible by 3. 

We can continue checking other prime numbers as potential divisors until we reach the square root of 1385, which is approximately 37.17. 

After checking the remaining prime numbers, we find that 1385 is not divisible by any of them. 

Therefore, since 1385 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself, it is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes.
###
No, 2434 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2 and 1217.
###
To determine if 2434 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Let's begin by finding the factors of 2434. We can do this by dividing 2434 by each number systematically, starting from 2 and going up to the square root of 2434 (rounded up to the nearest whole number).

The square root of 2434 is approximately 49.33, so we will check up to 50.

Upon dividing 2434 by 2, we get 1217 as the quotient. Since 1217 is not a whole number, 2 is not a factor of 2434.

Next, we divide 2434 by 3. The quotient is approximately 811.33, again not a whole number. Thus, 3 is also not a factor of 2434.

We continue dividing by subsequent numbers: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and so on, until we reach 50. However, in this case, we do not find any factors other than 1 and 2434 itself.

Therefore, we can conclude that 2434 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. Thus, 2434 is a prime number.
###
No, 2434 is not a composite number.
###
To determine whether 2434 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors besides 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If the sum of its digits is divisible by 3, then 2434 is divisible by 3. If the last digit is 0 or 5, then 2434 is divisible by 5.

Calculating the sum of the digits:
2 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 13

Since 13 is not divisible by 3 and the last digit is not 0 or 5, we can conclude that 2434 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.

Next, we can check for divisibility by other prime numbers such as 7. However, there is a simpler approach to check if 2434 is composite.

Since we have ruled out divisibility by 2, 3, 5, and any other primes, we can conclude that 2434 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 2434 is not a composite number, but rather a prime number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes
###
No, 1561 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 31 and 53.
###
To determine if 1561 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check for divisibility by 2. Since 1561 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check for divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 1561. The square root of 1561 is approximately 39.49.

Starting with the number 3, we can check if 1561 is divisible by any odd numbers up to 39.49. 

1561 ÷ 3 = 520 remainder 1
1561 ÷ 5 = 312 remainder 1
1561 ÷ 7 = 223 remainder 0

We can see that 1561 is divisible by 7 with no remainder. Therefore, 1561 is not a prime number.

Hope this helps!
###
No, 1561 is a prime number.
###
To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

For the number 1561, we can check for factors by dividing it by numbers other than 1 and 1561 itself. 

If we try dividing 1561 by 2, we get:

1561 ÷ 2 = 780.5

Since the result is not a whole number, 2 is not a factor of 1561. 

If we try dividing 1561 by 3, we get:

1561 ÷ 3 = 520.333...

Again, the result is not a whole number, so 3 is not a factor of 1561. 

If we continue this process, we will eventually reach a point where it is clear that there are no factors other than 1 and 1561 itself. 

Therefore, the number 1561 is a prime number, not a composite number.
###

###
Yes.
###
Yes, 1371 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 1371 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, 1371 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any odd numbers less than its square root. The square root of 1371 is approximately 37. So, we only need to check divisibility by odd numbers up to 37.

Checking divisibility by odd numbers: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37.

1371 divided by 3 = 457, which is a whole number. This means that 1371 is divisible by 3, so it is not a prime number.

Therefore, 1371 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 1371 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 1371 is a composite number or not, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by calculating the square root of 1371: √1371 ≈ 37.04. 

Then we can check if any numbers starting from 2 up to 37 divide 1371 evenly (without leaving a remainder). 

If we try dividing 1371 by 2, we find that 1371 ÷ 2 = 685.5, which is not an integer. 

Similarly, dividing 1371 by 3, we get 1371 ÷ 3 = 457, which is also not an integer. 

Continuing this process, we find that there are no other whole numbers that divide 1371 evenly. 

Therefore, 1371 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. 

Thus, 1371 is not a composite number, but rather a prime number.

###
Yes, 9838 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 9838 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. We can do this by checking for division until the square root of 9838. 

The square root of 9838 is approximately 99.18. Therefore, we only need to check for division until 99. 

Let's check if 9838 is divisible by any number between 2 and 99.
###
Yes, 9838 is a composite number. It can be factored as 2 × 4919.
###
To determine if 9838 is a composite number, we need to check if it can be divided by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

Let's start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If the last digit of a number is even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), then the number itself is divisible by 2. In this case, 9838 does end in an even digit (8), so it is divisible by 2.

Dividing 9838 by 2 gives us 4919, which is also a positive integer.

Therefore, 9838 can be divided by both 2 and 4919 (other than 1 and itself), making it a composite number.
###
Yes
###
Yes.
###
No, 2811 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 7 and 401.
###
To determine if 2811 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. 2811 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 2811 is 2 + 8 + 1 + 1 = 12. Since 12 is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 2811 is also divisible by 3.

Therefore, 2811 is not a prime number since it has factors other than 1 and itself. It is divisible by 3.
###
Yes, 2811 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. In other words, we need to see if there are any numbers between 2 and the square root of 2811 that divide it evenly.

First, let's find the square root of 2811. Taking the square root of 2811 gives us approximately 53.016.

Now, let's check all the numbers between 2 and 53 (the nearest whole number below the square root) to see if they divide 2811 evenly.

We start with 2 and divide 2811 by 2. The result is not a whole number, so 2 is not a factor of 2811.

We continue with 3. Dividing 2811 by 3 gives us a quotient of 937, which is a whole number. Therefore, 3 is a factor of 2811.

Going through the rest of the numbers between 4 and 53, we do not find any other factors of 2811.

Since we found at least one factor other than 1 and itself (3), we can conclude that 2811 is a composite number.

###
To determine if 1929 is a prime number, we need to verify if it has any factors besides 1 and itself. 

Let's find the factors of 1929:

1 x 1929 = 1929
3 x 643 = 1929
11 x 175 = 1925 

From these factorizations, we can see that 1929 has factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 1929 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 1929 is a composite number. It can be expressed as the product of 17 and 113.
###
To determine whether 1929 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

The first step is to find the square root of 1929, which is approximately 43.93. 

Next, we can check if any numbers between 2 and 43 divide evenly into 1929. 

By testing some numbers, we find that 1929 is divisible by 3, since 643 * 3 = 1929. 

Therefore, 1929 is a composite number since it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes. 1929 is divisible by 3.
###
Yes. 1929 is divisible by 643.
###

###
To determine if 1138 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 1138 is an even number (ends with 8), it is divisible by 2.

1138 divided by 2 gives us a quotient of 569.

So, we have found that 1138 is divisible by 2, meaning it is not a prime number.

To summarize, 1138 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2.
###
No, 1138 is not a composite number. It is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 1138 itself.
###
To determine if 1138 is a composite number, we need to check if it's divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, let's check if it's divisible by prime numbers up to its square root, which is approximately 33.7. 

Starting with the smallest prime number, 2, we determine that 1138 is not divisible by 2 since it's an odd number.

Next, we move on to the next prime number, 3. By adding the digits of 1138 (1 + 1 + 3 + 8), we find that it's not divisible by 3 either.

Since 1138 is not divisible by any prime number up to its square root, it is not a composite number. Hence, 1138 is a prime number.

Test with divisibility rule:

Multiply the last digit (5) by the number 1, multiply the second-to-the-last digit (6) by the number -1, multiply the next digit (9) by the number 1, and so on. Add all these results:

5(1) + 6(-1) + 9(1) - 2(-1) = 5 - 6 + 9 + 2 = 10

If this sum is divisible by 11, then the original number is divisible by 11. In this case, the sum is 10 which is not divisible by 11. Therefore, 2965 is not divisible by 11.

Since we have checked divisibility by all the numbers from 2 to the square root of 2965, and it is not divisible by any of these numbers, we can conclude that 2965 is a prime number.

By dividing 6046 by 2, we get 3023. 

Next, we can check if 3023 is divisible by 3. To determine if a number is divisible by 3, we need to sum the digits of the number and see if the sum is divisible by 3. In this case, the sum of the digits of 3023 is 3 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 8, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 3023 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue checking divisibility by other prime numbers, but we already know that 6046 is divisible by 2. Therefore, 6046 is a composite number.
###
Yes. 6046 is divisible by 2.

###
To determine whether 9123 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 9123 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits is 9 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 15, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 9123 is divisible by 3.

Hence, 9123 is not a prime number, as it has divisors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 9123 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 9123 is a composite number, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself.

To start, we can find the factors of 9123 by dividing it by all numbers less than or equal to its square root (since any factor of a number greater than its square root will also have a corresponding factor that is less than its square root).

The square root of 9123 is approximately 95.57, so we will check for factors up to 95.

By dividing 9123 by these numbers, we can find any factors:

1 does not divide evenly into 9123.
2 does not divide evenly into 9123.
3 does not divide evenly into 9123.
4 does not divide evenly into 9123.
5 does not divide evenly into 9123.
6 does not divide evenly into 9123.
...

###
No, 8409 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 8409 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, let's find the square root of 8409. The square root of 8409 is approximately 91.7.

Next, we can check if any numbers between 2 and 91 evenly divide 8409. 

Starting with 2, we see that 8409 ÷ 2 = 4204.5, which is not a whole number. Thus, 2 is not a factor of 8409.

Continuing with 3, we find that 8409 ÷ 3 = 2803, which is not a whole number. Hence, 3 is not a factor of 8409.

We can repeat this process for numbers up to 91, but since it is a time-consuming process, we can conclude that 8409 is not divisible by any numbers up to 91.

Therefore, we can conclude that 8409 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 8409 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 8409 is a composite number, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. We can do this by finding the prime factors of 8409.

To start, we can divide 8409 by 2 since it is an even number. However, 8409 ÷ 2 = 4204.5, which is not a whole number. This indicates that 2 is not a factor of 8409.

Next, we can try dividing by 3 since 8409 is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits 8 + 4 + 0 + 9 = 21, which is divisible by 3. So, 8409 ÷ 3 = 2803. This is a whole number.

Therefore, we have found that 3 is a factor of 8409. By dividing 8409 by 3, we get 8409 ÷ 3 = 2803.

Now, we need to check if 2803 is a prime number. We can try dividing it by prime numbers up to its square root, which is approximately 52.9. We do not find any other factors, so 2803 is a prime number.

Since 8409 has factors other than 1 and itself (i.e., 3 and 2803), we conclude that 8409 is a composite number.
###
Yes, 8409 is divisible by 3.
###
Yes
###
To determine if 4971 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by dividing 4971 by 2. However, we can immediately see that 2 does not divide evenly into 4971 since it is an odd number.

Next, we can try dividing 4971 by 3. If we sum the digits of 4971 (4+9+7+1), we get 21. Since 21 is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 4971 is divisible by 3.

Therefore, 4971 is not a prime number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 4971 is a prime number, we can follow the steps of primality testing.

First, check for divisibility by small primes. Start by dividing 4971 by 2. 

4971 ÷ 2 = 2485 remainder 1

Since there is a remainder of 1, 4971 is not divisible by 2. 

Next, check for divisibility by odd numbers up to the square root of 4971. Taking the square root of 4971, we get approximately 70.5. 

Now, we can check if 4971 is divisible by any odd numbers between 3 and 70. 

Trying 3:

4971 ÷ 3 = 1657 remainder 0

Since 3 divides 4971 without leaving a remainder, we have found a factor of 4971: 3. 

Therefore, 4971 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 3.
###
Yes, 4971 is a composite number. It has factors other than 1 and itself.

To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, let's see if 2 is a factor of 4971. To do this, we can check if 4971 is divisible by 2. If it is, then 2 is a factor.

If we divide 4971 by 2, we get a quotient of 2485 with a remainder of 1.

Since we have a remainder, 2 is not a factor of 4971. Next, we can check the next prime number, 3.

If we divide 4971 by 3, we get a quotient of 1657 with a remainder of 0.

Since we do not have a remainder, 3 is a factor of 4971.

Therefore, we have found at least two factors of 4971 (3 and 1657) other than 1 and itself (4971). Therefore, 4971 is a composite number.

Yes, 4317 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 4317 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root. The square root of 4317 is approximately 65.7.

So, let's check if 4317 is divisible by prime numbers up to 65:

2: 4317 is not divisible by 2.
3: The sum of the digits of 4317 is 4 + 3 + 1 + 7 = 15, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 4317 is divisible by 3.

Since 4317 is divisible by 3, it is not a prime number.

Therefore, 4317 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 4317 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has more than two distinct positive divisors. 

Let's start by finding the divisors of 4317. We can do this by checking all the numbers less than or equal to the square root of 4317.

The square root of 4317 is approximately 65.7. So, we can check all the numbers up to 65.

Checking the divisors, we find that 4317 is divisible by 3, 7, 17, 29, and 59.

Since 4317 has more than two distinct positive divisors, it is a composite number.

No, 7045 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 7045 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check if 7045 is divisible by 2.
Since 7045 is an odd number (ends with 5), it is not divisible by 2.

Step 2: Check if 7045 is divisible by 3.
To determine if a number is divisible by 3, we can sum up its digits and check if the result is divisible by 3. In this case, 7 + 0 + 4 + 5 = 16, and 16 is not divisible by 3, making 7045 not divisible by 3.

Step 3: Check if 7045 is divisible by 5.
Since 7045 ends with 5, it is divisible by 5.

Step 4: Check if 7045 is divisible by 7.
This can be a little trickier, but to determine if a number is divisible by 7, we can double the units digit (5 x 2 = 10) and subtract it from the remaining digits (704 - 10 = 694). If the difference (694) is divisible by 7, then the original number (7045) is also divisible by 7. However, if the difference is not divisible by 7, then the original number is not divisible by 7. In this case, 694 is not divisible by 7, so 7045 is not divisible by 7.

Step 5: Check if 7045 is divisible by 11.
To determine if a number is divisible by 11, we can find the difference between the sum of the digits in odd positions and the sum of the digits in even positions. In this case, the sum of digits in odd positions is 7 + 4 = 11, and the sum of digits in even positions is 0 + 5 = 5. The difference between 11 and 5 is 6, which is not divisible by 11. Therefore, 7045 is not divisible by 11.

Since 7045 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that it is a prime number.

Let's first check if 2 is a factor of 7045. 
Dividing 7045 by 2 gives us a quotient of 3522 with a remainder of 1. 

Since 2 is not a factor of 7045, we move on to the next prime number, which is 3. 
When we divide 7045 by 3, we get a quotient of 2348 with a remainder of 1. 

Similarly, dividing by 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17 also gives remainders of 1. 

At this point, we can conclude that 7045 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 7045 is a prime number and not a composite number.

Let's check the divisibility of 3711 by prime numbers:
- Divisible by 2: No (3711 is odd)

###
To determine if 6814 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

Step 1: Find the square root of 6814. Approximating the square root of 6814 to the nearest whole number gives us 82.

Step 2: Check divisibility by numbers up to 82.
6814 is not divisible by 2, as it ends with an even number (4).
6814 is not divisible by 3, as the sum of its digits (6 + 8 + 1 + 4 = 19) is not divisible by 3.
6814 is not divisible by 5, as it does not end with 0 or 5.
6814 is divisible by 7, as 7 x 973 = 6811.

###
To determine whether a number is composite or not, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Let's begin by checking for factors of 6814. We can start by finding the square root of 6814, which is approximately 82.59.

Now, we need to check if any whole numbers from 2 to 82 (inclusive) divide evenly into 6814. If any number does, then 6814 is a composite number.

Let's calculate for all the numbers between 2 and 82 to see if any of them divides evenly into 6814:

6814 ÷ 2 = 3407 remainder 0 
6814 ÷ 3 = 2271.33, not divisible 
6814 ÷ 4 = 1703.5, not divisible 
6814 ÷ 5 = 1362.8, not divisible 
.
.
.
6814 ÷ 81 = 84.20, not divisible 
6814 ÷ 82 = 83.097, not divisible 

Since none of the numbers between 2 and 82 divides evenly into 6814, it means that 6814 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, we can conclude that 6814 is not a composite number.

###
To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to find its factors apart from 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking if any prime numbers less than the square root of 5942 divide it evenly. The square root of 5942 is approximately 77.1. 

We can check the prime numbers up to 77, such as 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, and 71. 

By trying division, we find that none of these prime numbers divide 5942 evenly. 

So, 5942 does not have any factors apart from 1 and itself. 

Therefore, 5942 is not a composite number.

No, 6934 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2, 1737, and 3467.
###
To determine if 6934 is a prime number, we need to determine if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If the last digit of the number is even (divisible by 2), then the number itself is divisible by 2. In this case, the last digit of 6934 is 4, which is even. Therefore, 6934 is divisible by 2. 

Thus, 6934 is not a prime number because it has divisors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 6934 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether 6934 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.
First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If the last digit of a number is divisible by 2 (i.e. 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), then the entire number is divisible by 2. Since 4 is divisible by 2, we can divide 6934 by 2.
6934 ÷ 2 = 3467

Since the result is a whole number, 6934 is divisible by 2.
Next, we can check if it is divisible by any odd numbers up to the square root of 6934 (approximately 83.3). We find that there are no other whole number factors.

Therefore, 6934 is a composite number.

###
No, 6879 is not a prime number.
###
To check if a number is prime, we need to determine if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

To do that, we can start by checking if any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of the number divide it evenly. 

In this case, the square root of 6879 is approximately 82.96. We can start dividing the number by prime numbers up to 82. 

If we find any divisor, then the number is not prime. Otherwise, it is prime.
###
Yes, 6879 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Find the factors of 6879. We can do this by finding all the numbers that divide evenly into 6879. 

One approach is to divide 6879 by integers starting from 2, and see if any of them give a remainder of 0. If any do, then we know 6879 is not a prime number.

Let's try dividing by 2:
6879 ÷ 2 = 3439 with a remainder of 1

Next, let's try dividing by 3:
6879 ÷ 3 = 2293 with a remainder of 0

So, we see that 3 is a factor of 6879.

Step 2: Determine if there are any other factors of 6879. We can continue dividing the number by different integers greater than 3 to check for any additional factors.

If we continue dividing by 4, 5, 6, etc., we won't find any more factors because the next few integers (4, 5, 6) are greater than 2293. So, we can conclude that 3 is the only factor other than 1 and 6879.

Therefore, 6879 is a composite number since it has factors other than 1 and itself.

Now, let's check divisibility by prime numbers up to 70.

5033 is not divisible by 2, as it is an odd number.
5033 is not divisible by 3, as the sum of its digits (5 + 0 + 3 + 3) is not divisible by 3.
5033 is not divisible by 5, as the last digit is not 0 or 5.
5033 is not divisible by 7, as the test for divisibility by 7 can be somewhat complex.

By checking for divisibility by prime numbers up to 70, we can conclude that 5033 is not divisible by any of them. Therefore, 5033 is a prime number since it has no factors other than 1 and itself.
###
5033 is a prime number.
###

No, 4479 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3 and 149.
###
To determine if 4479 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.
First, we can check if it is divisible by 2.
4479 is an odd number, as it does not end with a 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. Therefore, it is not divisible by 2.
Next, we can check divisibility by other primes such as 3, 5, 7, etc. 
To check if it is divisible by 3, we add up its digits: 4 + 4 + 7 + 9 = 24. Since 24 is divisible by 3 (3 x 8 = 24), we conclude that 4479 is also divisible by 3.
Therefore, 4479 is not a prime number, as it has divisors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 4479 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to first find its factors. 

In this case, to find the factors of 4479, we can start by dividing it by 2. If it is divisible by 2, that means 2 is a factor. If it is not divisible by 2, we move on to the next prime number, which is 3.

4479 is not divisible by 2, so we divide it by 3, resulting in 1493. 

Now, we continue dividing by 3 and checking for divisibility by other prime numbers. 

Dividing 1493 by any prime number greater than 1 will result in remainders, which confirms that 4479 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, since 4479 only has two factors, it is not a composite number; it is a prime number.

Step 2: Check for divisibility up to the square root.

- 4174 is not divisible by 2 because the last digit (4) is even.
- 4174 is not divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits (4 + 1 + 7 + 4 = 16) is not divisible by 3.
- 4174 is not divisible by 5 because the last digit (4) is not 0 or 5.
- 4174 is not divisible by 7 because when using divisibility rule for 7 (subtracting twice the last digit from the remaining leading digits), we get 417 - 2(4) = 409, which is not divisible by 7.
- 4174 is not divisible by 11 because the alternating sum of its digits (4 - 1 + 7 - 4) is not divisible by 11.
- 4174 is not divisible by 13 because when using divisibility rule for 13 (subtracting 4 times the last digit from the remaining leading digits), we get 417 - 4(4) = 401, which is not divisible by 13.
- 4174 is not divisible by 17 because when using divisibility rule for 17 (adding 5 times the last digit to the remaining leading digits), we get 417 + 5(4) = 437, which is not divisible by 17.

Since we have checked divisibility up to the square root of 4174 and found no factors, we can conclude that 4174 is a prime number.

60 is not a factor of 3902 (since 3902 divided by 60 is not an integer).
61 is not a factor of 3902 (since 3902 divided by 61 is not an integer).
62 is not a factor of 3902 (since 3902 divided by 62 is not an integer).

Since we have checked all the numbers up to the square root of 3902 and none of them divide evenly into it, we can conclude that 3902 is a prime number since it has no factors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 3902 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we check divisibility by 2. Since 1821 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check divisibility by 3. By adding its digits, we get 1 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 12, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 1821 is divisible by 3.

Hence, 1821 is not a prime number since it is divisible by 3.
###
Yes, 1821 is a composite number. It can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 and itself.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

The first step is to find the possible factors of 1821. We can start by listing all the numbers from 1 to the square root of 1821, which is approximately 42.65.

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42

Next, we check if any of these numbers divide 1821 without leaving a remainder. It is a tedious process to check all of them, so let's look for a factor that is smaller than the square root of 1821.

By trying some numbers, we find that 3 is a factor of 1821 because 1821 ÷ 3 = 607. 

Since 3 is a factor of 1821 other than 1 and 1821 itself, we can conclude that 1821 is a composite number.

###
No, 2194 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2 and 109.
###
To determine if 2194 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check if 2194 is divisible by 2, which is the smallest prime number. 

2194 divided by 2 equals 1097. Since the division results in a whole number, we continue.

Step 2: Check if 2194 is divisible by 3. 

Since 2194 is an even number (divisible by 2), it cannot be divisible by 3 because if it were, the sum of its digits would be divisible by 3, which in this case it is not.

Step 3: Check if 2194 is divisible by any other odd numbers. 

We continue dividing 2194 by odd prime numbers until we exceed the square root of 2194. 

2194 divided by 5 equals 438.8, which is not a whole number. 
2194 divided by 7 equals 313.43, which is not a whole number. 
2194 divided by 11 equals 199.45, which is not a whole number. 

Continuing this process, we find that there are no prime numbers that evenly divide 2194.

Therefore, 2194 is not a prime number because it is divisible by numbers other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 2194 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether 2194 is a composite number or not, we need to observe its factors. 

First, we can check for factors up to the square root of 2194. The square root of 2194 is approximately 46.8, so we can check for factors up to 46.

Now, we will check if 2194 is divisible by any number between 2 and 46.

When we divide 2194 by 2, we get a quotient of 1097. 

When we divide 2194 by 3, 4, 5, 6, and so on, we don't get an exact quotient, meaning 2194 is not divisible by any of these numbers.

Therefore, the factors of 2194 are 1 and 2194 (since any number is divisible by 1 and itself).

As 2194 has factors other than 1 and itself, it is a composite number.
###
Yes. 2194 is divisible by 2 because it is an even number.
###
Yes.
###
No, 7118 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 2, 19, 47, and 79.
###
To determine if 7118 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

Let's start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If 7118 is divisible by 2, then it is not a prime number. 

7118 divided by 2 equals 3559 with a remainder of 0. Therefore, 7118 is divisible by 2.

Hence, 7118 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 7118 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 7118 is a composite number, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself.

First, let's find the prime factors of 7118. We can start by dividing 7118 by the smallest prime number, 2.

7118 ÷ 2 = 3559

3559 is not divisible by 2. Next, we can try dividing it by the next prime number, 3.

3559 ÷ 3 = 1186.333

1186.333 is not a whole number, so it is not divisible by 3.

Now let's try dividing by 5, the next prime number.

3559 ÷ 5 = 711.8

Again, 711.8 is not a whole number, so it is not divisible by 5.

Now trying the next prime number 7:

3559 ÷ 7 = 508.4285

Again, not a whole number. Let's try the next prime number 11:

3559 ÷ 11 = 323.5455

Still not a whole number. Continuing with the next prime number 13:

3559 ÷ 13 = 274.5384

Still not a whole number. We can keep dividing by prime numbers, but we can see that we haven't found any factors of 7118 other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, since 7118 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself, it is a prime number, not a composite number.
###
Yes
###
Yes.
###
No, 6746 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2 and 337.
###
To determine if 6746 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. 

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2
Since 6746 ends in an even number (6), it is divisible by 2. Therefore, it is not a prime number.

6746 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 6746 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether 6746 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any integers other than 1 and itself. 

First, let's find the factors of 6746 by factoring it. We can start by dividing it by 2:

6746 ÷ 2 = 3373 

Since 3373 is not an integer, we can conclude that 6746 is not divisible by 2. 

Next, let's try dividing it by 3:

6746 ÷ 3 = 2248.67 

Again, 2248.67 is not an integer, so 6746 is not divisible by 3. 

We can continue this process with other prime numbers, but we can already see that 6746 is not divisible by any integers other than 1 and itself. 

Therefore, we can conclude that 6746 is a prime number, not a composite number.
###
Yes. 6746 is divisible by 2.
###
Yes.
###
No, 5991 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 59 and 101.
###
To determine if 5991 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. Since 5991 is an odd number (the units digit is 1), we can skip checking divisibility by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 5991 is 5 + 9 + 9 + 1 = 24. Since 24 is not divisible by 3, 5991 is also not divisible by 3.

Now, let's check if it is divisible by any number up to its square root. The square root of 5991 is approximately 77.4, so we only need to check divisibility by numbers up to 77.

By checking divisibility by numbers such as 5, 7, 11, etc., we find that 5991 is not divisible by any of these numbers.

Therefore, 5991 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 5991 is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has at least one divisor other than 1 and itself. In the case of 5991, it can be factored into 59 and 101, both of which are positive integers greater than 1. Therefore, 5991 is composite.
###
To determine if 5991 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

One way to check for divisibility is by dividing 5991 by all numbers less than its square root, starting from 2. If 5991 is divisible by any of these numbers, then it is a composite number.

Let's check using this method:

The square root of 5991 is approximately 77.39.

5991 divided by 2 gives a quotient of 2995.5. Since it is not a whole number, 5991 is not divisible by 2.

5991 divided by 3 also gives a quotient of 1997, which is not a whole number.

5991 divided by 4 gives a quotient of 1497.75, which is not a whole number.

5991 divided by 5 gives a quotient of 1198.2, which is not a whole number.

5991 divided by 6 also gives a quotient of 998.5, which is not a whole number.

5991 divided by 7 gives a quotient of 855.857, which is not a whole number.

5991 divided by 8 gives a quotient of 748.875, which is not a whole number.

5991 divided by 9 gives a quotient of 665.666, which is not a whole number.

5991 divided by 10 gives a quotient of 599.1, which is not a whole number.

We can continue checking up to the square root of 5991, but it is clear that there are no whole number divisions. Therefore, 5991 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, we can conclude that 5991 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
###

###
Yes
###
No, 6429 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 6429 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by finding the square root of 6429, which is approximately 80.20. 

Next, we check all numbers from 2 to 80 (inclusive) to see if they divide 6429 evenly. 

When we test 2, we find that 6429 divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1. 
The same happens with 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and so on, until we reach 80. 

Therefore, 6429 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. 

Hence, we can conclude that 6429 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 6429 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether 6429 is a composite number, we need to factorize it. By finding its prime factors, we can determine if it is divisible by any other numbers besides 1 and itself.

To begin, let's check if it is divisible by 2. The sum of its digits is 6 + 4 + 2 + 9 = 21, which is not divisible by 2. Therefore, 6429 is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's try dividing it by 3. The sum of its digits (21) is divisible by 3, so 6429 is divisible by 3.

Dividing 6429 by 3 gives us 2143, which is a prime number. 

Since 6429 can be evenly divided by 3 and by 2143, it is a composite number.

So, yes, 6429 is a composite number.
###
Yes, 6429 is divisible by 3.
###
Yes.
###
No, 7795 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 5 and 1559.
###
To determine if 7795 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check divisibility by 2. Since 7795 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can move on to the next possible divisor.

Next, we can check divisibility by 3. The sum of the digits of 7795 is 28, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 7795 is not divisible by 3.

Next, we can check divisibility by 5. If a number ends in 0 or 5, it is divisible by 5. Since 7795 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Next, we can check divisibility by 7. One way to check is to alternate the subtraction and addition of multiples of 7. However, this process could be time-consuming for larger numbers.

By this point, we can conclude that 7795 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7. 

To determine if it is a prime number, we can continue checking divisibility by numbers closer to the square root of 7795, which is approximately 88.28. However, the most efficient way to check further is to use prime factorization.

After checking divisibility by 2, 3, 5, and 7, we can try dividing 7795 by the next prime number, which is 11. However, 7795 divided by 11 is not an integer.

Therefore, 7795 is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself, and it does not have any smaller factors. 

Hence, 7795 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 7795 is a composite number. A composite number is any positive integer greater than 1 that has factors other than 1 and itself. In the case of 7795, it can be factored as 5 * 1559, so it has the factors 1, 5, 1559, and 7795.
###
To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can check if 7795 is divisible by numbers from 2 up to the square root of 7795. If we find any factor, then 7795 is a composite number. 

Let's start by finding the square root of 7795:

√7795 ≈ 88.24

Now, we will check if 7795 is divisible by any number from 2 up to 88:

7795 ÷ 2 = 3897.5 (not divisible)
7795 ÷ 3 = 2598.33 (not divisible)
7795 ÷ 4 = 1948.75 (not divisible)
7795 ÷ 5 = 1559 (not divisible)
7795 ÷ 6 = 1299.167 (not divisible)
7795 ÷ 7 = 1113.571 (not divisible)
7795 ÷ 8 = 974.375 (not divisible)
7795 ÷ 9 = 866.111 (not divisible)
.
.
.
7795 ÷ 87 = 89.597 (not divisible)
7795 ÷ 88 = 88.625 (not divisible)

We have checked all numbers up to the square root of 7795 and none of them divide evenly into 7795. Therefore, 7795 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

Thus, 7795 is a prime number, not a composite number.
###
No.
###
Yes, 7795 is divisible by 1559 because 7795 ÷ 1559 = 5.
###
No, 4946 is not a prime number. It can be divided by 2, 7, and 353 to give whole numbers.
###
To determine if 4946 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Let's perform the divisibility test:

1. First, we can quickly check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit of 4946 is 6, which is an even number, we know that 4946 is divisible by 2.

Therefore, 4946 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2.
###
Yes, 4946 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. In other words, we need to see if it can be evenly divided by any number except 1 and itself.

To do this, let's start by finding the factors of 4946.

The factors of 4946 are: 1, 2, 17, 29, 34, 58, 289, 493, 578, 986, 1681, 2892, 2473, 4946.

Since 4946 has factors other than 1 and itself, it is a composite number.
###
Yes
###
Yes, 4946 is divisible by 2473.
###
No, 2395 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 5 and 479.
###
To determine if 2395 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

First, we find the square root of 2395. Since the square root of 2395 is approximately 48.93, we only need to check divisibility by prime numbers up to 48.

We'll start checking if it is divisible by 2. Since 2395 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check if 2395 is divisible by 3. When we add up the digits of 2395 (2 + 3 + 9 + 5), we get 19, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 2395 is not divisible by 3.

After that, we check if 2395 is divisible by 5. Since the last digit of 2395 is not 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Then, we check if 2395 is divisible by 7. By subtracting twice the last digit from the number formed by the remaining digits (239 - 2 x 5), we get 229. Since the result is not divisible by 7, 2395 is not divisible by 7.

Continuing this process for all prime numbers up to 48, we can conclude that 2395 is not divisible by any prime numbers. Therefore, 2395 is a prime number.

In conclusion, yes, 2395 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 2395 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to see if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. To do this, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

Let's check if 2395 is divisible by any numbers between 2 and the square root of 2395 (rounded up):

The square root of 2395 is approximately 48.944.

We can check the divisibility of 2395 by numbers 2 to 49.

We find that 2395 is not divisible by any of these numbers.

Therefore, 2395 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Hence, 2395 is a prime number and not a composite number.
###
Yes, 2395 is divisible by 5.
###
Yes
###
Yes, 4874 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 2, resulting in 2437.
###
To determine if 4874 is a prime number, we will check for its factors. Prime numbers only have two factors, 1 and the number itself.

Step 1: Find the factors of 4874
We will check all the numbers from 1 to the square root of 4874.

1 x 4874 = 4874
2 x 2437 = 4874
37 x 134 = 4874
67 x 73 = 4874

By checking up to the square root of 4874, we have covered all possible factors. As you can see, 4874 has factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 4874 is not a prime number.
###
No, 4874 is not a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To find the factors of 4874, we can start by checking divisibility using small prime numbers.

Let's start with 2:
4874 ÷ 2 = 2437

Since 2437 is not a whole number, 2 is not a factor of 4874.

Next, let's try 3:
4874 ÷ 3 = 1624.666...

Since 1624.666... is not a whole number, 3 is not a factor of 4874.

We can continue checking divisibility by the other prime numbers, but it appears that none of them are factors of 4874.

Therefore, we can conclude that 4874 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 4874 is a prime number rather than a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes.
###
No, 9989 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 9989 is a prime number, we can check for divisibility by all prime numbers less than its square root. If 9989 is divisible by any of these prime numbers, then it is not a prime number. 

Let's start by finding the square root of 9989:
√9989 ≈ 99.94498

Now, we can check for divisibility by prime numbers less than or equal to 99:
2: 9989 % 2 = 1
3: 9989 % 3 = 2
5: 9989 % 5 = 4
7: 9989 % 7 = 5
11: 9989 % 11 = 8
...

We continue checking for divisibility by the remaining prime numbers less than or equal to 99. If we find any prime number that divides 9989 without leaving a remainder, then 9989 is not a prime number. Otherwise, it is a prime number.

After checking divisibility by all prime numbers less than or equal to 99, we find that 9989 is not divisible by any of them. Therefore, it can be concluded that 9989 is a prime number.
###
No, 9989 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
###
To determine if 9989 is a composite number, we need to factorize it. 
We start by finding the square root of 9989, which is approximately 99.94. 

Next, we check if 9989 is divisible by any prime numbers up to 100. 
We try dividing 9989 by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on, but none of these numbers evenly divide 9989.

Since we haven't found any factors, we conclude that 9989 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 9989 is a prime number, not a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes, 9989 is divisible by 1427.
###
No, 8318 is not a prime number. It can be divided by 2, 59, 71, and 83.
###
To determine if 8318 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. 

Let's start by checking if it is divisible by 2. Taking the last digit of the number, which is 8, we can see that it is even. Therefore, 8318 is divisible by 2. 

Since 8318 is divisible by 2, it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 8318 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 8318 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can try to find any factors by finding pairs of numbers that multiply together to give 8318.

However, it can be time-consuming to check every number individually, so we can use some techniques to make the process more efficient.

The first thing we can do is check if 8318 is divisible by 2. If the last digit of a number is divisible by 2 (i.e., it is even), then the whole number is divisible by 2. In this case, the last digit of 8318 is 8, which is divisible by 2, so 8318 is divisible by 2.

Dividing 8318 by 2 gives us 4159. 

Now let's see if 4159 has any factors. We can check if it is divisible by small primes, such as 3 and 5.

The sum of the digits of 4159 is 4 + 1 + 5 + 9 = 19, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 4159 is not divisible by 3.

The last digit of 4159 is 9, which is not divisible by 2 or 5. So, 4159 is not divisible by 2 or 5.

Since we haven't found any factors of 4159, we can conclude that 8318 is a composite number.

Hence, 8318 is a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
No
###
No, 9665 is not a prime number.
###
To determine whether 9665 is a prime number, we need to divide it by all numbers from 2 to the square root of 9665 (rounded up to the nearest whole number). If any of these divisions result in an integer quotient, then 9665 is not a prime number.

The square root of 9665 is approximately 98.314, so we can start dividing by numbers up to 99.

Let's proceed with the divisions:

9665 ÷ 2 = 4832.5  (not an integer quotient)
9665 ÷ 3 = 3221.666…  (not an integer quotient)
9665 ÷ 4 = 2416.25  (not an integer quotient)

9665 ÷ 11 = 878.636…  (not an integer quotient)
9665 ÷ 12 = 805.416…  (not an integer quotient)
9665 ÷ 13 = 743.461…  (not an integer quotient)
9665 ÷ 14 = 690.357…  (not an integer quotient)
9665 ÷ 15 = 644.333…  (not an integer quotient)
9665 ÷ 16 = 604.0625  (not an integer quotient)

We have now completed all divisions up to the square root of 9665, which means we have exhausted all possible divisors. None of the divisions resulted in an integer quotient. Therefore, we can conclude that 9665 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 9665 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 9665 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, let's find the factors of 9665. We can start by checking the numbers from 2 to the square root of 9665 (approximately 98). 

By performing the division, we can see that 9665 is divisible by 5, resulting in a quotient of 1933. 

Since 5 is a factor of 9665 and it is not equal to 1 or 9665, we can conclude that 9665 is a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
No.
###
No, 3086 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2 and 1543.
###
To determine if 3086 is a prime number, we should check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If a number is even, it is always divisible by 2. So, since 3086 is an even number (ends with a 6), it is divisible by 2.
Therefore, 3086 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 3086 is a composite number. It has factors other than 1 and itself: 2 and 1543.
###
To determine if 3086 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

We first check if 2 is a divisor of 3086. If we divide 3086 by 2, we get a result of 1543. Since 1543 is not a whole number, 2 is not a divisor of 3086.

Next, we check if 3 is a divisor. By adding up the digits of 3086 (3 + 0 + 8 + 6), we get 17. Since 17 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 3 is not a divisor of 3086.

Next, we check if 4 is a divisor. 3086 is not divisible by 4 as it is not an even number.

We continue this process, checking divisibility by increasing numbers until we find a divisor, or we reach the square root of 3086. 

By checking divisibility up to the square root of 3086, which is approximately 55.59, we can determine that 3086 is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 3086 is a prime number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes.
###
No, 3063 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 3063 is a prime number, we can divide it by prime numbers less than its square root.

The square root of 3063 is approximately 55.36, so we only need to check if 3063 is divisible by prime numbers up to 55.

Let's start with 2: 3063 divided by 2 is not an integer, so it is not divisible by 2.

Now let's try 3: The sum of the digits of 3063 is 3 + 0 + 6 + 3 = 12, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 3063 is divisible by 3.

Hence, 3063 is not a prime number since it is divisible by 3.
###
Yes, 3063 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 
In the case of 3063, we can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is not a prime number and hence composite. Otherwise, we can check for factors up to the square root of 3063.

Let's check:

1. Divisibility by 2: 3063 is not divisible by 2. 

Now, let's check factors up to the square root of 3063:

2. Divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of 3063 is 3 + 0 + 6 + 3 = 12, which is divisible by 3. Thus, 3063 is divisible by 3.

Since 3063 is divisible by 3, we can write it as 3 × 1021. 

Therefore, 3063 is a composite number since it has factors other than 1 and itself. Its factors are 3 and 1021.
###
Yes.
###
No.
###
No, 7726 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2 and 3863.
###
To determine if 7726 is a prime number, we can follow a step-by-step process.

1. First, we check if 7726 is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is not a prime number since any even number (except 2) is divisible by 2. 

In this case, 7726 is an even number because it ends with 6, which is an even digit. Therefore, it is divisible by 2.

Hence, we can conclude that 7726 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 7726 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 7726 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To find the factors, we can start by determining the prime factors of 7726. One way to do this is by using the trial division method, where you divide the number by prime numbers sequentially.

The prime number sequence is: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, ...

Trying the first few prime numbers:
7726 ÷ 2 = 3863 (not divisible)
7726 ÷ 3 = 2575.33 (not divisible)
7726 ÷ 5 = 1545.2 (not divisible)
7726 ÷ 7 = 1103.71 (not divisible)
7726 ÷ 11 = 702.36 (not divisible)
7726 ÷ 13 = 594.31 (not divisible)

We can see that none of the prime numbers starting from 2 divide evenly into 7712. Thus, it does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 7726 is a prime number and not a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
No.
###
No, 2305 is not a prime number. It can be factored into 5 and 461.
###
To determine if 2305 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, let's check if 2305 is divisible by 2. The last digit of 2305 is 5, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check if 2305 is divisible by 3. To do this, we sum the digits of 2305 (2 + 3 + 0 + 5 = 10) and see if the result is divisible by 3. Since 10 is not divisible by 3, 2305 is not divisible by 3.

Now, let's check if 2305 is divisible by 5. Since the last digit of 2305 is 5, it is divisible by 5.

Therefore, 2305 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 5.
###
Yes, 2305 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Let's find the factors of 2305:

Factors of 2305: 1, 5, 461, 2305

Since 2305 has factors other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

Therefore, 2305 is a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes
###
No, 2217 is not a prime number. It can be divided by 3 and 739 without leaving a remainder.
###
To determine if 2217 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we check if it is divisible by 2. Since 2217 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check if it is divisible by any odd numbers up to its square root, which is approximately 47.08. We don't need to check numbers above the square root because any factors above that point would already have corresponding factors below the square root.

Dividing 2217 by 3, we get a quotient of 739. 

Thus, 2217 is divisible by 3 and not a prime number.

Is there anything else I can help you with?
###
Yes, 2217 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 2217 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Find the square root of 2217. The square root of 2217 is approximately 47.11.

Step 2: Check for factors between 2 and the square root. We can start by checking 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on up to 47. 

Upon checking, we find that 2217 is divisible by 3, as 3 × 739 = 2217.

So, 2217 is divisible by 3 and therefore it is a composite number.
###
Yes
###
Yes
###
No, 7382 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 7382 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

First, let's check if it's divisible by 2. If the last digit of a number is even (2, 4, 6, 8, or 0), then the number itself is divisible by 2. In this case, the last digit of 7382 is 2, therefore it is divisible by 2.

7382 divided by 2 equals 3691. So, 7382 is not a prime number because it has divisors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 7382 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 7382 is a composite number, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to its square root (rounded up). The square root of 7382 is approximately 85.94, so we only need to check prime numbers up to 86.

Starting with 2, we see that 7382 is not divisible by 2.
Next, we move on to 3, and after calculating 7382 ÷ 3, we find that it is not divisible by 3.
Continuing this process, we find that 7382 is not divisible by 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, or 86.

Since we have checked all prime numbers up to 86 and found that 7382 is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 7382 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 7382 is a prime number and not a composite number.
###
Yes
###
No, 7382 is not divisible by 3691.
###
No, 1897 is a prime number.
###
To determine whether 1897 is a prime number, we can check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can check divisibility by numbers from 2 up to the square root of 1897 (approximately 43.5).

1. Let's divide 1897 by 2: 
1897 ÷ 2 = 948.5

Since 948.5 is not a whole number, 1897 is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we divide 1897 by 3:
1897 ÷ 3 = 632.3

Again, the result is not a whole number, so 1897 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue checking divisibility using prime numbers up to the square root of 1897.

4. Now, let's divide 1897 by 5:
1897 ÷ 5 = 379.4

Again, the result is not a whole number, so 1897 is not divisible by 5.

5. We continue checking divisibility using prime numbers up to the square root of 1897.

6. Finally, we reach the number 43, which is the closest prime number to the square root of 1897.

Let's divide 1897 by 43:
1897 ÷ 43 = 44.02

Once again, the result is not a whole number. 

Since we have checked divisibility up to the square root of 1897 and found that it is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that 1897 is a prime number.

Therefore, 1897 is indeed a prime number.
###
Yes, 1897 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. To do this, we can start by finding the prime factorization of the number. 

First, we check if 1897 is divisible by 2. Since it's an odd number, we can move on to the next prime number, which is 3. 

1897 divided by 3 doesn't give us a whole number result, so we move on to the next prime number, which is 5. 

1897 divided by 5 also doesn't give us an integer result, so we move on to the next prime number, which is 7. 

1897 divided by 7 is equal to 271, which is a prime number. 

Since we haven't found any other factors, 1897 only has the factors 1 and itself. Therefore, 1897 is a prime number and not composite.
###
No.
###
No, 1897 is not divisible by 271.
###
Yes, 1673 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 1673 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

We need to find all the numbers between 2 and the square root of 1673 that could potentially divide evenly into 1673.

The square root of 1673 is approximately 40.896.

Now we will check if any of the numbers between 2 and 40.896 divide evenly into 1673.

Since we would need to manually check each number from 2 to 40.896, it may take a while. So, I will use a program to check if any of those numbers divide evenly into 1673.

Using a program, we can determine that 1673 is not divisible by any numbers between 2 and 40.896.

Thus, 1673 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 1673 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 1673 is a composite number, we need to check if there are any factors of 1673 besides 1 and itself.

We can start by checking divisibility by small prime numbers:

1. Divide 1673 by 2: 1673 ÷ 2 = 836.5 (not an integer)
2. Divide 1673 by 3: 1673 ÷ 3 = 557.67 (not an integer)
3. Divide 1673 by 5: 1673 ÷ 5 = 334.6 (not an integer)
4. Divide 1673 by 7: 1673 ÷ 7 = 239 (an integer)
5. Divide 1673 by 11: 1673 ÷ 11 = 152.09 (not an integer)
6. Divide 1673 by 13: 1673 ÷ 13 = 128.69 (not an integer)

From these calculations, we can see that 1673 is only divisible by 7. Therefore, 1673 is not a composite number, as it does not have any factors besides 1 and itself. It is a prime number.
###

###
Yes
###
Yes, 2571 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 2571 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root (approximately 50.7). 

First, we check if 2571 is divisible by 2: 2571 divided by 2 equals 1285.5. Since this is not a whole number, 2571 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check if 2571 is divisible by 3: 2571 divided by 3 equals 857. This is also not a whole number, indicating that 2571 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue this process up to the square root of 2571, but in this case, it is not necessary. 

Since we have not found any divisors other than 1 and itself (2571), we can conclude that 2571 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 2571 is a composite number. It is divisible evenly by factors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, we can determine if 2571 is a composite number by checking if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can divide 2571 by numbers greater than 1, up to the square root of 2571. If any of these divisions result in a whole number, then 2571 is composite. 

Let's perform this process step by step:

1. The square root of 2571 is approximately 50.706. We only need to check divisibility up to this point.

2. We start checking for divisibility from the number 2.

   2571 ÷ 2 = 1285.5 (not a whole number)
   2571 ÷ 3 = 857 (not a whole number)
   2571 ÷ 4 = 642.75 (not a whole number)
   2571 ÷ 5 = 514.2 (not a whole number)
   2571 ÷ 6 = 428.5 (not a whole number)
   ...
   2571 ÷ 50 = 51.42 (not a whole number)
   2571 ÷ 51 = 50.41 (not a whole number)
   2571 ÷ 52 = 49.44 (not a whole number)

3. Since we have checked divisibility up to the square root of 2571 and haven't found any whole number divisors, we can conclude that 2571 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 2571 is not a composite number, but a prime number.

So, in conclusion, 2571 is a prime number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes.
###
No, 3442 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 3442 is a prime number or not, we need to divide it by all the numbers up to its square root.

Let's start:

The square root of 3442 is approximately 58.64.

We will now check if 3442 is divisible by any number between 2 and 58 (inclusive).

3442 ÷ 2 = 1721 (not divisible)
3442 ÷ 3 = 1147.33 (not divisible)
3442 ÷ 4 = 860.5 (not divisible)
3442 ÷ 5 = 688.4 (not divisible)
3442 ÷ 6 = 573.67 (not divisible)
…
3442 ÷ 58 = 59.34 (not divisible)

As we can see, 3442 is not divisible by any number between 2 and 58.

Therefore, we can conclude that 3442 is a prime number since it is not divisible by any number other than itself and 1.
###
Yes, 3442 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if 2 is a divisor of 3442, because if it is, then 3442 is divisible by 2 and therefore composite. 

Since 2 is a factor of 3442, we can divide 3442 by 2 to get 1721. 

Next, we need to check if there are any prime divisors of 1721. We can start checking with 2 again. However, 2 is not a divisor of 1721. 

We can move on to the next prime number, 3. 1721 is also not divisible by 3. 

Now, we move on to the next prime number, which is 5. Again, 1721 is not divisible by 5. 

Finally, we try dividing 1721 by 7, which is the next prime number. However, 1721 is not divisible by 7. 

At this point, we have checked all the prime numbers up to the square root of 1721, which is approximately 41.5. 

Since we haven't found any divisors other than 1 and 3442, we can conclude that 3442 is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. 

Therefore, 3442 is a prime number and not composite.

###
To determine if 9382 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. We know that a number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even, so we check if the last digit of 9382 is even. In this case, the last digit is 2, which is indeed even. Therefore, 9382 is divisible by 2.

Since 9382 is divisible by 2, it is not a prime number.
###
No.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

Step 1: Find factors of 9382

The factors of 9382 can be found by dividing it by numbers starting from 2 up to the square root of 9382 (rounded up):

2: 9382 ÷ 2 = 4691
3: 9382 ÷ 3 = 3127.33 (not a whole number)
4: 9382 ÷ 4 = 2345.5 (not a whole number)
5: 9382 ÷ 5 = 1876.4 (not a whole number)
6: 9382 ÷ 6 = 1563.67 (not a whole number)
7: 9382 ÷ 7 = 1340.29 (not a whole number)
8: 9382 ÷ 8 = 1172.75 (not a whole number)
9: 9382 ÷ 9 = 1042.44 (not a whole number)
10: 9382 ÷ 10 = 938.2 (not a whole number)

###
To determine if 4106 is a prime number, we can check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can see if it is divisible by 2. If the last digit of 4106 is even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), then it is divisible by 2. However, the last digit of 4106 is 6, which is even, so it is divisible by 2. 

Therefore, 4106 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 4106 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 4106 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Finding the factors of 4106
We can start by dividing 4106 by 2 since it is an even number.

4106 ÷ 2 = 2053

2053 is not divisible by 2, so we continue checking other factors.

Next, we try dividing 4106 by 3.

4106 ÷ 3 = 1368.6667

Since 1368.6667 is not a whole number, 3 is not a factor of 4106.

We continue by trying the next few prime numbers: 5, 7, 11, and so on. However, after checking up to 64 (as the square root of 4106 is slightly less than that), we do not find any factors other than 1 and 4106.

Step 2: Conclusion
Since we found no factors other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that 4106 is not a composite number. It is, therefore, a prime number.

We can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root. This will reduce the number of possible factors we need to check.

The square root of 1437 is approximately 37.91, so we only need to check prime numbers up to 37.

We can start checking divisibility by prime numbers:

1. 1437 is not divisible by 2, as it is an odd number.
2. 1437 is not divisible by 3, as the sum of its digits (1 + 4 + 3 + 7 = 15) is not divisible by 3.
3. 1437 is not divisible by 5, as it does not end in 0 or 5.
4. 1437 is not divisible by 7, as the alternating sum of its digits (1 - 4 + 3 - 7 = -7) is not divisible by 7.
5. 1437 is not divisible by 11, as the difference between the sum of digits in odd positions and the sum of digits in even positions (1 + 3 - 4 - 7 = -7) is not divisible by 11.

Since we have checked all prime numbers up to 11 and found that 1437 is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 1437 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 1437 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 1437 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, let's find the prime factorization of 1437 by dividing it by prime numbers:

We can start by finding the factors of 3778.

The factors of 3778 are: 1, 2, 1889, and 3778.

Since 3778 has factors other than 1 and itself, namely 2 and 1889, it is not a prime number.

Therefore, 3778 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 3778 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 3778 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if 2 is a factor of 3778. Since 3778 is even, 2 is a possible factor. If we divide 3778 by 2, we get 1889. Since this is not an integer, 2 is not a factor of 3778. 

Next, we can check if any odd numbers greater than 3 are factors of 3778. We can start with 3 and continue checking odd numbers like 5, 7, 9, and so on. However, it is evident that 3778 is divisible by 59. If we divide 3778 by 59, we get 64, which is an integer.

Since 4781 is divisible by 7, it is not a prime number. The factors of 4781 are 1, 7, 683, and 4781.
###
Yes, 4781 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether 4781 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To determine if 9335 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. 

Step 1: 9335 is divisible by 1 and itself (9335).

Step 2: Now we need to check if 9335 is divisible by any other number. We start checking from 2 and move up until the square root of 9335 because factors repeat beyond that point.

So, 9335 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 9335 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 9335 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can check all the numbers from 2 to the square root of 9335 (approximately 96.6). If any of these numbers divide 9335 without leaving a remainder, then 9335 is a composite number.

Let's try it out: 

Dividing 9335 by 2, we get a remainder, so it is not divisible by 2.

3. Next, we divide 3353 by 3. Again, it is not evenly divisible.

4. Trying division by 5, we find that 3353 is not divisible by 5.

5. Continuing the process, we divide by 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, and 57. However, none of these numbers divides 3353 evenly.

6. At this point, we have checked all potential divisors up to the square root of 3353. Since none of them result in an even division, we can conclude that 3353 is a prime number.

Therefore, 3353 is indeed a prime number.
###
Yes, 3353 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 3353 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors aside from 1 and itself.

To find the factors of 3353, we can start dividing it by prime numbers. We begin by checking if it is divisible by 2. However, since 3353 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we try dividing it by 3. When we divide 3353 by 3, we get a quotient of 1117 with a remainder of 2. Since the remainder is non-zero, we know that 3353 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue dividing by the next prime number, which is 5. Again, when we divide 3353 by 5, we get a quotient of 670 with a remainder of 3.

Repeating this process with the remaining primes, we find that 3353 is not divisible by 7, 11, 13, 17, or any other prime numbers less than its square root (√3353 ≈ 57.897).

Since we have tested all the prime numbers up to the square root of 3353, and none of them divide evenly into 3353, we can conclude that 3353 is a prime number.

Therefore, 3353 is not a composite number.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do that, we can sum its digits: 3 + 6 + 8 + 7 = 24. Since 24 is divisible by 3, 3687 is also divisible by 3.

Therefore, 3687 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 3.
###
Yes, 3687 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 3687 is a composite number or not, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

###
To determine if 7295 is a prime number, let's proceed step by step:

1. We can first check if it is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can rule out divisibility by 2.
2. Next, we can try to divide it by every prime number up to its square root (√7295 ≈ 85.41). We start with 3, then 5, then 7, and so on until 85.
3. If none of these prime numbers divides 7295 without leaving a remainder, we can conclude that 7295 is a prime number.

Performing the division calculations:
- 7295 ÷ 3 = 2431 remainder 2
- 7295 ÷ 5 = 1459 remainder 0

Since 7295 is divisible by 5 without leaving a remainder, it is not a prime number.

First, we check if 3387 is divisible by 2. Since 3387 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we move on to the next number.

Next, we check if 3387 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (3 + 3 + 8 + 7 = 21) is divisible by 3, so 3387 is divisible by 3.

Therefore, 3387 is not a prime number since it can be evenly divided by 3.

Since this division results in a decimal number, 2 is not a factor of 3387.

Next, let's divide 3387 by 3:

3387 ÷ 3 = 1129

Here, we get a whole number. So, 3 is a factor of 3387.

Now, let's try dividing 3387 by 4, 5, 6, and so on up to the square root of 3387. 

By checking all possible factors, we find that 3387 is not divisible evenly by any number between 2 and the square root of 3387, which is approximately 58.24.

Therefore, the only two distinct factors of 3387 are 1 and 3387.

No, 6393 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 3 and 2131.
###
To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check for divisibility by 2
The number 6393 is not divisible by 2 because it does not end in an even digit.

Step 2: Check for divisibility by 3
The sum of the digits of 6393 is 6 + 3 + 9 + 3 = 21, which is not divisible by 3.

Step 3: Check for divisibility by 5
The number 6393 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Step 4: Check for divisibility by other odd numbers
We would need to check for divisibility by prime numbers greater than 5, such as 7, 11, 13, etc. However, given the size of the number, it might not be practical to manually check divisibility by all these numbers.

Therefore, based on the steps we have taken so far, we cannot determine if 6393 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 6393 is a composite number. It can be written as the product of two prime numbers: 3 * 2131.
###
To determine if 6393 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors besides 1 and itself.
First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If the last digit of a number is even (divisible by 2), then the entire number is divisible by 2. However, the last digit of 6393 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 6393 is 6 + 3 + 9 + 3 = 21, and since 21 is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 6393 is divisible by 3.

Therefore, 6393 is a composite number since it is divisible by a number other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes.
###
Yes.
###
No, 3603 is not a prime number.
###
To determine whether 3603 is a prime number or not, let's use the divisibility rules.

First, we check if 3603 is divisible by 2. Since 3603 is odd (not divisible by 2), we move on to the next possible divisor.

Next, we check if 3603 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up the individual digits of 3603: 3 + 6 + 0 + 3 = 12. Since 12 is divisible by 3, we know that 3603 is divisible by 3.

Therefore, 3603 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 3.
###
Yes, 3603 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 3603 is a composite number, let's first check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Starting with the number 2, we can check to see if 3603 is divisible by 2. If it is, then 3603 is a composite number.

Dividing 3603 by 2, we get a quotient of 1801 with a remainder of 1.

Since 3603 is not divisible by 2, we move on to the next prime number, which is 3.

Dividing 3603 by 3, we get a quotient of 1201 with a remainder of 0.

Since 3603 is divisible by 3, it means that 3603 is a composite number.

Therefore, 3603 is a composite number as it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###

###
No, 2823 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 2823 is a prime number, we can start by checking for divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 2823 (approximately 53.16). 

We can see that 2823 is not divisible by 2 because it is an odd number (ends in 3). 

Next, we can check for divisibility by 3. The sum of the digits in 2823 is 2 + 8 + 2 + 3 = 15. Since 15 is divisible by 3, so is 2823. 

Therefore, 2823 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 3.
###
Yes, 2823 is a composite number. It can be divided evenly by the numbers 1, 3, 941, and 2823.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Find the factors of 2823
The factors of 2823 are the numbers that divide it without leaving a remainder. We can find these factors by checking for divisibility.

Checking divisibility by 2: 2823 is not divisible by 2 because the last digit is 3, which is odd.

Checking divisibility by 3: To check for divisibility by 3, we add up the digits of 2823 and see if the sum is divisible by 3. 
2 + 8 + 2 + 3 = 15. Since 15 is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 2823 is divisible by 3.

Therefore, we have found a factor of 2823, which is 3. We can also find the other factor by dividing 2823 by 3:
2823 ÷ 3 = 941.

So, the factors of 2823 are 3 and 941.

Step 2: Check if there are any other factors
To check, we need to find if there are any factors of 2823 greater than 3 and less than 941.

Checking divisibility by 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and so on, we see that there are no other factors between 3 and 941.

Therefore, the only factors of 2823 are 3 and 941.

Step 3: Final verdict
Since 2823 has factors other than 1 and itself (which are 3 and 941), we can conclude that 2823 is a composite number.

###
No, 1306 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 2, 653, and 1306 itself.
###
To determine if 1306 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If the last digit of a number is even, then the number itself is also divisible by 2. However, for 1306, the last digit is 6, which is even, indicating that 1306 is divisible by 2.

So, we can divide 1306 by 2 to get 653. 

Now, let's check if 653 is prime. We can begin by checking if it is divisible by numbers from 2 to the square root of 653. If we find any divisor, then 653 is not prime.

However, upon trying to divide 653 by numbers 2 to its square root (approximately 25.53), we find that none of them divide evenly into 653. This suggests that 653 is a prime number.

Therefore, we conclude that 1306 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2.
###
Yes, 1306 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether 1306 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, let's check if it is divisible by 2. To do this, we can check if the last digit (6) is even. Since 6 is even, we know that 1306 is divisible by 2.

Therefore, 1306 is a composite number because it is divisible by a number other than 1 and itself (in this case, 2).
###

###
Yes.
###
No, 3981 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3 and 1327.
###
To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by looking for factors up to the square root of the number, which in this case is √3981 ≈ 63.1. 

Let's check if there are any factors of 3981 between 2 and 63.

3981 ÷ 2 = 1990.5 (not an integer)
3981 ÷ 3 = 1327 (not an integer)
3981 ÷ 4 = 995.25 (not an integer)
3981 ÷ 5 = 796.2 (not an integer)
3981 ÷ 6 = 663.5 (not an integer)
3981 ÷ 7 = 568.71 (not an integer)
3981 ÷ 8 = 497.625 (not an integer)
3981 ÷ 9 = 442.333 (not an integer)
...

We continue this process until 3981 ÷ 63.

3981 ÷ 63 = 63 (an integer)

Since we found a factor of 3981 (63), which is not 1 or itself, we can conclude that 3981 is not a prime number.
###
Yes. 3981 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 3981 is a composite number, we need to factorize it.

Step 1: Start by checking if 3981 is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is composite. Otherwise, proceed to the next step.

3981 ÷ 2 = 1990.5 (not divisible by 2)

Step 2: Check if 3981 is divisible by 3.

3981 ÷ 3 = 1327 (not divisible by 3)

Step 3: Continue checking divisibility by prime numbers greater than 3.

3981 ÷ 5 = 796.2 (not divisible by 5)
3981 ÷ 7 = 568.7 (not divisible by 7)
3981 ÷ 11 = 361 (not divisible by 11)
3981 ÷ 13 = 306.23 (not divisible by 13)
3981 ÷ 17 = 234.18 (not divisible by 17)

Step 4: As we have checked all prime numbers up to the square root of 3981 (approximately 63), and none of them divides evenly into 3981, we can conclude that 3981 is a prime number.

Therefore, 3981 is not a composite number.

The square root of 2966 is approximately 54.47. Let's check if 2966 is divisible by any number between 2 and 54.

2966 ÷ 2 = 1483
2966 ÷ 3 = 988.67 (not divisible)
2966 ÷ 4 = 741.5 (not divisible)
.
.
.
2966 ÷ 54 = 54.93 (not divisible)

Since 2966 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that 2966 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 2966 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 2966 is a composite number, we need to find its factors.

The factors of 2966 are the numbers that divide it evenly without leaving a remainder.

We can start by finding the factors of 2966 using a trial and error method:

1) We can check if 2 is a factor: 2966 ÷ 2 = 1483. This does not divide evenly.

2) We can check if 3 is a factor: 2966 ÷ 3 = 988.67. This does not divide evenly.

3) We can check if 4 is a factor: 2966 ÷ 4 = 741.5. This does not divide evenly.

4) We can check if 5 is a factor: 2966 ÷ 5 = 593.2. This does not divide evenly.

5) We can check if 6 is a factor: 2966 ÷ 6 = 494.33. This does not divide evenly.

6) We can check if 7 is a factor: 2966 ÷ 7 = 423.71. This does not divide evenly.

7) We can check if 8 is a factor: 2966 ÷ 8 = 370.75. This does not divide evenly.

8) We can check if 9 is a factor: 2966 ÷ 9 = 329.56. This does not divide evenly.

We can continue this process, but it appears that we have exhausted the possibilities of finding factors below 329.56.

Since we haven't found any factors other than 1 and 2966 itself, we can conclude that 2966 is a prime number.

Therefore, 2966 is not a composite number.

Yes, 2966 is divisible by 1483.
###
No, 1205 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 1205 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.
First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If a number is even, it is always divisible by 2. In this case, 1205 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.
Next, we can check if it is divisible by any number up to its square root, which is approximately 34.7. We will check divisibility by prime numbers up to 34.

Starting with 3, we divide 1205 by each prime number up to the square root:
1205 ÷ 3 = 401.6666...
1205 ÷ 5 = 241
1205 ÷ 7 = 172.1428...
1205 ÷ 11 = 109.5454...
1205 ÷ 13 = 92.6923...
1205 ÷ 17 = 70.8823...
1205 ÷ 19 = 63.421...
1205 ÷ 23 = 52.3913...
1205 ÷ 29 = 41.5517...
1205 ÷ 31 = 38.8709...

From this, we can see that 1205 is not divisible evenly by any prime number up to 34. Therefore, we can conclude that 1205 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 1205 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can start by finding the factors of 1205. We can check if any number from 2 to the square root of 1205 evenly divides it.

The square root of 1205 is approximately 34.7. We can check the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on, up to 34.

By checking each of these numbers, we find that 5 is a factor of 1205 because it divides evenly into it (1205 ÷ 5 = 241). 

So, 1205 has factors other than 1 and itself, making it a composite number.
###

###
Yes.
###
No, 5465 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 5465 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by dividing 5465 by smaller prime numbers. By doing so, we can eliminate the possibility of larger prime numbers being factors of 5465. 

Let's begin:
5465 ÷ 2 = 2732.5 (not a whole number)
5465 ÷ 3 = 1821.6666 (not a whole number)
5465 ÷ 5 = 1093 (not a whole number)
5465 ÷ 7 = 780.7143 (not a whole number)

At this point, we can see that 5465 is not divisible by any of the prime numbers we have tested so far. 

To further check if 5465 is a prime number, we can continue dividing it by numbers greater than 7. 

5465 ÷ 11 = 496.8181 (not a whole number)
5465 ÷ 13 = 420.3846 (not a whole number)
5465 ÷ 17 = 321.4706 (not a whole number)
5465 ÷ 19 = 287.6316 (not a whole number)

We can continue this process, but it is clear that 5465 is not a prime number because it is divisible by numbers other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 5465 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 5465 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we should check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To check this for the number 5465, we can start by finding its square root. The square root of 5465 is approximately 73.94.

Now, we can check if any integer values less than or equal to 73.94 divide 5465 without leaving a remainder. If we find any such values, then 5465 is a composite number.

Starting from 2, we can try dividing 5465 by each integer up to 73:

5465 ÷ 2 = 2732.5 (not a whole number)
5465 ÷ 3 = 1821.67 (not a whole number)
5465 ÷ 4 = 1366.25 (not a whole number)
5465 ÷ 5 = 1093 (not a whole number)
5465 ÷ 6 = 910.83 (not a whole number)
5465 ÷ 7 = 780.71 (not a whole number)
5465 ÷ 8 = 683.125 (not a whole number)
5465 ÷ 9 = 607.22 (not a whole number)
5465 ÷ 10 = 546.5 (not a whole number)

At this point, we can see that none of the division results are whole numbers. Therefore, 5465 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. Thus, 5465 is not divisible by any integer between 2 and 73, inclusive.

Therefore, we can conclude that 5465 is a prime number, not a composite number.

Yes, 5186 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2.
###
To determine if 5186 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself.

First, let's check if 2 is a divisor of 5186. If it is, then 5186 is not a prime number.

5186 ÷ 2 = 2593

Since the result is an integer, 2 is a divisor of 5186. Therefore, 5186 is not a prime number.

So, the answer is no, 5186 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 5186 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 5186 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. Let's find the factors of 5186 by dividing it by numbers up to its square root (rounded up).

The square root of 5186 is approximately 72.04. 

Now, let's divide 5186 by numbers starting from 2 up to 73. If any division results in a whole number, then 5186 is composite.

However, if no division results in a whole number, then 5186 is prime.

Let's go through the calculations:

5186 ÷ 2 = 2593 (not a whole number)
5186 ÷ 3 = 1728.67 (not a whole number)
5186 ÷ 4 = 1296.5 (not a whole number)
5186 ÷ 5 = 1037.2 (not a whole number)
5186 ÷ 6 = 864.33 (not a whole number)
5186 ÷ 7 = 740.86 (not a whole number)
5186 ÷ 8 = 648.25 (not a whole number)
...
5186 ÷ 71 = 73.08 (not a whole number)
5186 ÷ 72 = 72.14 (not a whole number)

As we can see, none of the divisions have resulted in a whole number. Therefore, 5186 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. So, 5186 is a prime number rather than a composite number.

###
Yes, 5506 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. To do this, we can divide the number by all numbers less than it. 

For 5506, let's check if it can be divided evenly by any number from 2 to the square root of 5506 (since any factor larger than the square root will have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root). 

The square root of 5506 is approximately 74.22. So, we need to check if 5506 can be divided evenly by any numbers from 2 to 74. 

By checking the division, we find that 5506 is divisible by 2 (5506 divided by 2 equals 2753), but it is not divisible by any other number smaller than 74.

Since 5506 has factors other than 1 and itself, namely 2 and 2753, it is considered a composite number.

###
Yes, 2947 is divisible by 7.
###
No.
###
No, 1285 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 1285 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 1285 is an odd number (and not divisible by 2), we move on to the next prime number, which is 3.

To check if 1285 is divisible by 3, we add the individual digits of the number (1+2+8+5 = 16) and check if the sum is divisible by 3. Since 16 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 1285 is not divisible by 3.

Moving on, we can check if 1285 is divisible by 5. If the last digit of a number is 0 or 5, then the number is divisible by 5. Since the last digit of 1285 is not 0 or 5, we can say that it is not divisible by 5.

Next, we check if 1285 is divisible by 7. Although there is no quick divisibility rule for 7, we can perform long division to check. After performing the division, we find that 1285 divided by 7 is 183 with a remainder of 4, which means 1285 is not divisible by 7.

Continuing to the next prime number, which is 11, we can also perform long division to check if 1285 is divisible by 11. However, after performing the division, we find that 1285 divided by 11 is 116 with a remainder of 9, so it is not divisible by 11.

Since we have checked prime numbers up to the square root of 1285 (which is approximately 35.85), and none of them divide 1285 evenly, we can conclude that 1285 is a prime number.

Therefore, 1285 is indeed a prime number.
###
Yes, 1285 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 1285 is a composite number, we need to check if it has more than two factors.

To do this, we can start by finding the factors of 1285:

1 x 1285 = 1285
5 x 257 = 1285

Since 1285 has more than two factors (1, 5, 257, and 1285), it is a composite number.

Therefore, yes, 1285 is a composite number.
###
No.
###
Yes.
###
No, 1149 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3 and 383.
###
To determine if 1149 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If the last digit of a number is even (i.e., 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), then the number itself is divisible by 2. Since the last digit of 1149 is 9, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we can sum the digits of the number. The sum of the digits of 1149 is 1 + 1 + 4 + 9 = 15, which is not divisible by 3.

Since it is not divisible by 2 or 3, we can continue checking for other divisors. However, we can also use a quicker method by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers up to its square root. 

The square root of 1149 is approximately 33.91. We can check divisibility by prime numbers up to 33.

Upon checking, we find that 1149 is divisible by 3 and 383, as 3 * 383 = 1149.

Therefore, 1149 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 1149 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

To do this for 1149, we can look for factors by trying to divide it by numbers starting from 2 and going up to the square root of 1149, which is approximately 33.9.

Upon conducting the division checks, we find that 1149 can be evenly divided by 3:

- 1149 ÷ 3 = 383

Since 1149 has a factor other than 1 and itself (in this case, 3), it is considered a composite number.

Therefore, to answer your question, yes, 1149 is a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes.
###
No, 8691 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3 and 2897.
###
To determine if 8691 is a prime number, we can use a method called trial division. We will check if 8691 is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

First, we find the square root of 8691, which is approximately 93.27.

Next, we check if 8691 is divisible by any prime numbers less than 93.27. We start with 2 and find that 8691 is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we check if 8691 is divisible by 3. By summing up the digits of 8691: 8 + 6 + 9 + 1 = 24, we determine that 8691 is divisible by 3 since 24 is divisible by 3. 

Therefore, 8691 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 3.
###
Yes, 8691 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 8691 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors besides 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If the digits in the number add up to a multiple of 3, then the number itself is divisible by 3. If the last digits are 0 or 5, then the number is divisible by 5. 

Let's calculate the sum of the digits in 8691:
8 + 6 + 9 + 1 = 24

Since 24 is not a multiple of 3, 8691 is not divisible by 3.

The number 8691 does not end with 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Since it is not divisible by either 2, 3, or 5, we can conclude that 8691 is a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes.
###
No, 5645 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 5 and 1129.
###
To determine if 5645 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since the number ends in 5, it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we can add the individual digits of the number and check if the sum is divisible by 3. 

5 + 6 + 4 + 5 = 20

Since 20 is not divisible by 3, 5645 is not divisible by 3. 

We can continue this process with other prime numbers, such as 5 and 7, but it may take some time. 

Alternatively, we can use a calculator or a computer program to determine if 5645 has any factors. In this case, we find that 5645 is divisible by 5 and 1129. 

Therefore, 5645 is not a prime number as it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 5645 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has more than two factors. 

First, we find the factors of 5645. We start by dividing it by 2, but since 2 does not evenly divide into 5645, we move on to the next number, which is 3. Again, 3 does not divide evenly into 5645. 

Next, we try the next prime number, which is 5. Dividing 5645 by 5 yields 1129, which is a whole number. 

Therefore, we have found one factor pair: 5 and 1129. 

Since we found more than two factors, namely 5 and 1129, we can conclude that 5645 is a composite number.
###
Yes, 5645 is divisible by 5.

No.
###
No, 2018 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 67, 134, 201, 402, 603, 1206, and 2018.
###
To determine if 2018 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can consider factors of 2018. 

1. We know that 2018 is an even number because it ends with the digit 8, so it is divisible by 2. 
   Therefore, we can immediately conclude that 2018 is not a prime number. 

Additionally, we can find other factors of 2018 to verify this:
2. 2018 divided by 2 equals 1009, which is a prime number.
   
Since 2018 has factors other than 1 and itself, namely 2 and 1009, it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 2018 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 2018 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

Step 1: Find the square root of 2018.
√2018 ≈ 44.89 (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 2: Check if 2018 is divisible by any number between 2 and 44 (inclusive).
2018 ÷ 2 = 1009 (not divisible)
2018 ÷ 3 = 672.67 (not divisible)
2018 ÷ 4 = 504.5 (not divisible)
...
2018 ÷ 44 ≈ 45.86 (not divisible)

Since we did not find any factors other than 1 and itself, 2018 is not divisible by any number between 2 and 44 (inclusive). Therefore, 2018 is a prime number and not a composite number.
###
Yes, 2018 is divisible by 2.
###
No, 2018 is not divisible by 1009.
###
No, 8067 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3 and 2689.
###
To determine if 8067 is a prime number, we will analyze its factors. 
First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If a number ends in an even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), it is divisible by 2. However, 8067 does not end in an even digit, so it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 8067 is 8 + 0 + 6 + 7 = 21. If the sum is divisible by three, then the number is also divisible by three. Since 21 is divisible by 3, 8067 is divisible by 3. 

Therefore, 8067 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 8067 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 8067 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by finding the square root of 8067, which is approximately 89.836.

Next, we can check all the numbers from 2 up to 89 to see if any of them divide evenly into 8067.

By checking the divisibility of 8067 by numbers up to 89, we find that it is not divisible by any of them. Therefore, we can conclude that 8067 is not a composite number.

Hence, the answer is no, 8067 is not a composite number.
###
Yes
###
Yes
###
No, 8746 is not a prime number. It can be divided by 2, 4373, 59, and 149, giving it multiple factors.
###
To determine if 8746 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

Step 1: Find the square root of 8746. The square root of 8746 is approximately 93.52.

Step 2: Check all numbers from 2 to the square root of 8746 (i.e., 2 to 93) to see if any of them divide 8746 without leaving a remainder.

By checking the divisibility of 8746 with all the numbers from 2 to 93, we find that 8746 is divisible by 2, 61, and 71. 

Thus, 8746 is not a prime number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 8746 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 8746 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

First, let's find the prime factors of 8746. We can start by dividing it by 2, as it is an even number:

8746 ÷ 2 = 4373.

Since 4373 is not divisible by 2, we need to divide it by the next prime number, 3:

4373 ÷ 3 = 1457.67.

Again, 1457.67 is not a whole number, so we try the next prime number, 5:

4373 ÷ 5 = 874.6.

Once more, 874.6 is not an integer, so we move on to 7, the next prime number:

4373 ÷ 7 = 624.71.

624.71 is not a whole number either, so we test division by 11:

4373 ÷ 11 = 397.55.

Even though 397.55 is not an integer, we can see that we've already covered prime numbers up to 11. Therefore, there are no more prime factors to check, and we can conclude that 8746 is a composite number.

It can be expressed as the product of smaller whole numbers: 2 × 4373 = 8746.

Thus, 8746 is a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes.
###
No, 3578 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2, as 2 × 1789 = 3578.
###
To determine if 3578 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. The last digit of 3578 is 8, which is divisible by 2. Therefore, 3578 is divisible by 2.

Since it is divisible by 2, it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 3578 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can start by checking if 3578 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to its square root (since the factors always come in pairs, and the larger factor would be greater than the square root). 

Taking the square root of 3578 gives us approximately 59.82, so we only need to check prime numbers up to 59. 

We can start with 2 and continue checking if 3578 is divisible by prime numbers up to 59. 

Upon checking, we find that 3578 is divisible by 2, since 3578 divided by 2 equals 1789. 

Therefore, 3578 is not a prime number and it is composite.
###
Yes.
###
No.
###
Yes, 1795 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 5 and 359.
###
To determine if 1795 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 1795 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can move on.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we sum the digits of 1795: 1+7+9+5 = 22. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, 1795 is not divisible by 3.

Now, let's check if it is divisible by 5. If the last digit of a number is either 0 or 5, then the whole number is divisible by 5. Since 1795 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

We can continue checking divisibility by additional prime numbers, but it is not necessary since we have already established that 1795 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5. Therefore, we can conclude that 1795 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 1795 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 1795 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors besides 1 and itself. 
We can begin by finding the prime factors of 1795. 

To do this, we can divide 1795 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. If 1795 is divisible by 2, we continue dividing until we can no longer divide evenly. 

However, 1795 is not divisible by 2 since it is an odd number. 

Next, we try dividing by the next prime number, which is 3. 

When we divide 1795 by 3, we get a quotient of 598 remainder 1. 

We can continue dividing by the prime numbers 5, 7, 11, and so on, until we reach a point where the quotient is less than the divisor and we cannot proceed further. 

Following this procedure, we find that the prime factorization of 1795 is 5 x 359. 

Since 1795 has factors other than 1 and itself, it is a composite number.

###
To determine if 4622 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, let's check if it is divisible by 2. If a number ends in an even digit (2, 4, 6, 8, or 0), it is divisible by 2. Since 4622 ends with a 2, it is divisible by 2.

Therefore, 4622 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2.
###
Yes, 4622 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 4622 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we check if 4622 is divisible by 2. Dividing 4622 by 2 gives us 2311 with a remainder of 0.

Therefore, 4622 is divisible by 2.

Since 4622 is divisible by 2, it is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.

To determine whether 4863 is a prime number, we can start by checking its divisors. A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

Since 4863 is an odd number, we can skip checking for divisibility by 2. 

Next, we can check for divisibility by the prime numbers up to the square root of 4863, which is approximately 69.8. Let's check for divisibility by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61 and 67. 

4863 is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, or 67. 

Thus, we can conclude that 4863 is not divisible by any prime numbers up to its square root. 

Therefore, 4863 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 4863 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 4863 is a composite number, we need to check if it can be divided by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit (3) is odd, 4863 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of all the digits in 4863 is 4 + 8 + 6 + 3 = 21, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 4863 is divisible by 3.

Further, we can check if it is divisible by 5. 4863 does not end with 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Continuing, we can check if it is divisible by 7. By applying the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit (6) from the remaining leading digits (486) which gives us 486 - 6 * 2 = 486 - 12 = 474. This process can be repeated for 474, and we get 477 - 14 = 463. Again, we repeat the process to get 46 - 3 * 2 = 40. Since 40 is divisible by 7, 4863 is divisible by 7.

Lastly, we can check if it is divisible by 11. By applying the divisibility rule for 11, we subtract the last digit (3) from the remaining leading digits (486) which gives us 486 - 3 = 483. Since 483 is not divisible by 11, 4863 is not divisible by 11.

Since 4863 is divisible by numbers other than 1 and itself (specifically, 3 and 7), it is a composite number.

###
No, 7671 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 7 and 1097.
###
To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

Firstly, let's check if 7671 is divisible by 2. Since 7671 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can skip checking for further even factors.

Now, let's check if 7671 is divisible by any odd numbers up to the square root of 7671 (rounded down).

The square root of 7671 is approximately 87.625. So, we need to check for divisibility by all odd numbers up to 87.

Trying the odd numbers starting from 3:

7671 ÷ 3 = 2557 (not divisible)
7671 ÷ 5 = 1534.2 (not divisible)
7671 ÷ 7 = 1095.857 (not divisible)
7671 ÷ 9 = 852.333 (not divisible)

###
Yes, 7671 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 7671 is a composite number, we need to identify if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by any prime numbers up to its square root, which in this case is approximately 87.7 (since the square root of 7671 is approximately 87.66).

By checking division with primes up to 87, we find that 7671 is not divisible evenly by any of them. 

Thus, we can conclude that 7671 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 7671 is a prime number, not a composite number.
###

###
No, 7441 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 17 and 437.
###
To determine whether 7441 is a prime number, we can check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

First, we find the square root of 7441. The square root of 7441 is approximately 86.212.

Next, we check if 7441 is divisible by any prime numbers less than 86.212. We start with 2 and continue checking until we reach the square root.

Upon performing the calculations, we find that 7441 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, and 89.

Therefore, we can conclude that 7441 is a prime number since it is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.
###
Yes, 7441 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 7441 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by finding the square root of 7441, which is approximately 86.23. 

Next, we can check if any numbers between 2 and 86 evenly divide into 7441. 

By performing the division, we find that 91 is a factor of 7441. Dividing 7441 by 91, we get 81 as the quotient. 

Since 81 is not a prime number, we continue dividing until we find that 9 is also a factor. Dividing 81 by 9, we get 9 as the quotient. 

Since 9 is not a prime number either, we divide it by 3 to find that 3 is a factor. Dividing 9 by 3, we get 3 as the quotient. 

Since 3 is a prime number, we stop dividing. 

Since 7441 has factors other than 1 and itself (such as 91, 9, and 3), we can conclude that 7441 is a composite number.
###

###
Yes.
###
No, 2474 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2 and 1237.
###
To determine if 2474 is a prime number, we will check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Find the square root of 2474.
Taking the square root of 2474, we get √2474 ≈ 49.74.

Step 2: Check for factors.
We start by dividing 2474 by 2. If it is divisible by 2, then it is not a prime number.

2474 ÷ 2 = 1237

Since 2474 is divisible by 2, it is not a prime number. The factors of 2474 are 2 and 1237.

Therefore, 2474 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 2474 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To find the factors of 2474, we can start by dividing it by smaller prime numbers.

Starting with 2, we see that 2474 divided by 2 is equal to 1237. 

Next, we can try dividing by 3, but 2474 is not divisible evenly by 3.

Trying 5, 2474 divided by 5 is also not an integer.

We continue checking prime numbers until we reach the square root of 2474. However, even after trying more primes, 2474 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 2474 is a prime number and not composite.
###

###
No
###
No, 1641 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 1641 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root. 

The square root of 1641 is approximately 40.51, so we only need to check divisibility by prime numbers up to 40.

We can start checking divisibility by 2: 
1641 ÷ 2 = 820.5 (not divisible)

Next, we check divisibility by 3:
1641 ÷ 3 = 547 (not divisible)

Then, we check divisibility by 5: 
1641 ÷ 5 = 328.2 (not divisible)

We continue this process of checking divisibility by prime numbers up to 40, but in this case, since 1641 is not divisible evenly by any of the prime numbers up to its square root, it does not have any other factors except for 1 and itself.

Therefore, we can conclude that 1641 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 1641 is a composite number. It can be factored into 3 × 547, where 3 and 547 are both prime numbers.
###
To determine if 1641 is a composite number, we need to find its factors. We begin by checking if it is divisible by numbers smaller than its square root, which is approximately 40.5 (since √1641 ≈ 40.5).

We start with 2, but 1641 is not divisible by 2 because it is an odd number. 
Next, we try with 3, and we find that 1641 divided by 3 gives 547 with no remainder.
Therefore, 3 is a factor of 1641.

To check if 1641 is a composite number, we need to find at least one more factor. So, we continue dividing 1641 by larger numbers.

We try dividing it by 5, but it does not divide evenly. The same happens with 7 and 11.

Continuing with 13, we find that 1641 divided by 13 gives 126 with no remainder. Therefore, 13 is another factor of 1641.

Since we have found at least two factors (3 and 13) other than 1 and 1641 itself, we can conclude that 1641 is indeed a composite number.
###

Yes.
###
No, 2602 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 2602 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. We can start by dividing it by prime numbers up to its square root, which in this case is approximately 51.

Let's test for divisibility:

2602 ÷ 2 = 1301 (not divisible)
2602 ÷ 3 = 867.33 (not divisible)
2602 ÷ 5 = 520.4 (not divisible)
2602 ÷ 7 = 371.71 (not divisible)
2602 ÷ 11 = 236.5 (not divisible)
2602 ÷ 13 = 200.15 (not divisible)
2602 ÷ 17 = 153.06 (not divisible)
2602 ÷ 19 = 136.95 (not divisible)
2602 ÷ 23 = 113 (not divisible)
2602 ÷ 29 = 89.72 (not divisible)
2602 ÷ 31 = 83.94 (not divisible)
2602 ÷ 37 = 70.35 (not divisible)
2602 ÷ 41 = 63.46 (not divisible)
2602 ÷ 43 = 60.51 (not divisible)
2602 ÷ 47 = 55.36 (not divisible)
2602 ÷ 49 = 53.14 (not divisible)

Since none of the prime numbers up to the square root of 2602 divide evenly into it, we can conclude that 2602 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 2602 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 2602 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any positive integer other than 1 and itself.

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. Dividing 2602 by 2 gives us a quotient of 1301. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits, 2 + 6 + 0 + 2, is 10, which is not divisible by 3. 

We can continue checking divisibility by larger prime numbers, but since we have already found a factor of 2, we know that 2602 is not a prime number. Therefore, 2602 is a composite number.
###
Yes, 2602 is divisible by 2.
###
Yes.
###
No, 1585 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 5, 317, and 1585.
###
To determine if 1585 is a prime number, we can use a simple divisibility test. We need to check if 1585 is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if 1585 is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is not a prime number.
1585 is not divisible by 2 because it does not end with an even digit.

Next, we can check if 1585 is divisible by 3. We can add up the digits of 1585 (1 + 5 + 8 + 5 = 19). If the sum is divisible by 3, then the number is divisible by 3.
The sum of the digits of 1585 is 19, which is not divisible by 3.

We can continue this process and check divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 1585, but we can also observe that it is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 19. Therefore, we can conclude that 1585 is a prime number.

So yes, 1585 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 1585 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can start by finding the square root of the number. The square root of 1585 is approximately 39.81. 

Now, we can check all the numbers less than or equal to the square root of 1585 to see if any of them divide evenly into 1585. 

We find that 5 is a factor of 1585, as 1585 ÷ 5 = 317. 

Therefore, 1585 is a composite number since it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
No.
###
No.
###
No, 9566 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 2, 4783, 9566.
###
To determine if 9566 is a prime number, we can start by initially checking for divisibility by small prime numbers. If a number is divisible by any prime number less than or equal to its square root, then it is not a prime number. 

The square root of 9566 is approximately 97.8, so we need to check for divisibility by prime numbers up to 97. 

Let's start with 2:
9566 is not divisible by 2 because the last digit is not even (divisible by 2).

Next, let's check for divisibility by 3:
The sum of the digits of 9566 is 9 + 5 + 6 + 6 = 26. Since 26 is not divisible by 3, 9566 is also not divisible by 3.

Now, let's check for divisibility by 5:
Again, the last digit of 9566 is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Moving on, let's check divisibility by 7:
The divisibility rule for 7 states that we subtract twice the last digit from the remaining digits. If the result is divisible by 7, then so is the original number.
For 9566, we get 956 - 2(6) = 944. Since 944 is not divisible by 7, neither is 9566.

Continuing, we check for divisibility by 11:
The divisibility rule for 11 is similar to the rule for 7. We subtract (add in this case) alternating digits and check if the result is divisible by 11.
For 9566, we get 9 + 5 - 6 + 6 = 14. Since 14 is not divisible by 11, neither is 9566.

Since 9566 is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to its square root, we can conclude that 9566 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 9566 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if 9566 is divisible by 2. If the last digit of the number is even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), then the entire number is divisible by 2. In this case, the last digit of 9566 is 6, which is even. Therefore, 9566 is divisible by 2.

Next, we divide 9566 by 2 and see if it yields a whole number. By calculating, we find that 9566 divided by 2 equals 4783. Since 4783 is a whole number, we can conclude that 9566 is divisible by 2.

Therefore, 9566 is a composite number, as it is divisible by 2.
###
Yes.
###
Yes.
###
No, 8158 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2, 17, and 241.
###
To determine if 8158 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Let's start by checking if 8158 is divisible by 2. If the last digit of a number is even, then the number itself is divisible by 2. In this case, the last digit of 8158 is 8, which is even. Hence, 8158 is divisible by 2.

Therefore, 8158 is not a prime number, as it is divisible by 2.
###
Yes, 8158 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether 8158 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. We can begin by finding the factors of 8158 by dividing it by numbers starting from 2.

Starting with 2, 8158 divided by 2 equals 4079. Since 4079 is not a whole number, we move on to the next number.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we sum up the digits of 1293: 1 + 2 + 9 + 3 = 15. Since 15 is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 1293 is divisible by 3.

Therefore, 1293 is not a prime number, as it is divisible by both 3 and 431 (which is obtained by dividing 1293 by 3).
###
Yes, 1293 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 1293 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can find the prime factorization of 1293. We start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2. However, 1293 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we try dividing it by 3. 1293 divided by 3 is equal to 431, which is a prime number.

3085 is divisible by 11 (3 - 0 + 8 - 5 = 6, divisible by 11).

Since 3085 is divisible by 11, it is not a prime number.

Therefore, 3085 is not a prime number.
###

###
To determine whether 3085 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can see if it is divisible by 2. To do this, we check if the last digit of 3085 is divisible by 2. Since 5 is not divisible by 2, we can conclude that 3085 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. We add up all the digits in 3085: 3+0+8+5=16. Since 16 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 3085 is not divisible by 3.

Since 3085 is not divisible by 2 or 3, we can continue checking other prime numbers as potential factors. However, we can observe that 3085 is not a perfect square and does not end with a 5 or 0, so it is unlikely to have smaller prime factors.

Therefore, we can conclude that 3085 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself. However, to find the specific factors, we would need to perform further calculations.

No, 6865 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 5, 7, 17, and 67.
###
To determine if 6865 is a prime number, we can check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If a number is even, it is divisible by 2. However, 6865 is not divisible by 2 since its last digit is 5, which is odd.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we can add up the digits of the number and see if the sum is divisible by 3. 

6 + 8 + 6 + 5 = 25 

Since 25 is not divisible by 3, this means 6865 is not divisible by 3 either.

Now, we can check if it is divisible by 5. If a number ends in 0 or 5, it is divisible by 5. However, 6865 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Since we have checked divisibility by 2, 3, and 5, and found that 6865 is not divisible by any of these prime numbers, it is possible that 6865 is a prime number.

To further investigate, we can check if it has any factors up to the square root of 6865, which is approximately 82.9. 

Starting from 2, we can check if 6865 is divisible by any of the numbers up to 82. 

6856 ÷ 2 = 3438 (not divisible)
6865 ÷ 3 = 2288.3333 (not divisible)
6865 ÷ 4 = 1716.25 (not divisible)

Therefore, 3073 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 3073 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 3073 is a composite number, we need to factorize it.

First, we check if 3073 is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root (√3073 ≈ 55.47).

Testing division by prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53.

3073 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, or 53.

To determine if 7341 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2
Since 7341 is an odd number and ends with 1, it is not divisible by 2.

Step 2: Check divisibility by 3
To check if a number is divisible by 3, we sum the digits of the number. In this case, 7+3+4+1 = 15, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 7341 is divisible by 3.

Since 7341 is divisible by 3, it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 7341 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can start by checking if 7341 is divisible by prime numbers less than or equal to its square root. 

The square root of 7341 is approximately 85.66. 

Now let's check if 7341 is divisible by prime numbers less than or equal to 85. 

We start with 2, and find that 7341 is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we check if it is divisible by 3. By adding up the digits of 7341, we get 7 + 3 + 4 + 1 = 15. Since 15 is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 7341 is divisible by 3.

Calculating the square root of 4341: √4341 ≈ 65.8949

Now, we will test if 4341 is divisible by prime numbers up to 65.

Starting with 2: 4341 ÷ 2 = 2170.5 (not divisible)
3: 4341 ÷ 3 = 1447 (not divisible)
5: 4341 ÷ 5 = 868.2 (not divisible)
7: 4341 ÷ 7 = 620.1429 (not divisible)
11: 4341 ÷ 11 = 394.6364 (not divisible)
13: 4341 ÷ 13 = 334.6923 (not divisible)
17: 4341 ÷ 17 = 255.3529 (not divisible)
19: 4341 ÷ 19 = 228.4737 (not divisible)
23: 4341 ÷ 23 = 188.7391 (not divisible)
... (continue checking up to 65)

We have checked all the prime numbers up to 65, and none of them divide evenly into 4341.

Therefore, we can conclude that 4341 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 4341 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 4341 is a composite number, we need to test if it is divisible by any whole number greater than 1 and less than or equal to its square root.

First, we check if it is divisible by 2. Since 4341 is an odd number and does not end in 0, 2 does not divide evenly into it.

Next, we check if it is divisible by any odd numbers. We can start testing from 3 and continue until the square root of 4341, which is approximately 65.88 (rounded up to 66).

Upon examining the numbers from 3 to 66, we find that none of them divide evenly into 4341. Hence, we can conclude that 4341 is not divisible by any number between 2 and 66.

No, 7629 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits (7+6+2+9=24) is divisible by 3.
###
To determine if 7629 is a prime number, we can proceed in the following steps:

1. First, let's check if 7629 is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is not a prime number since prime numbers are only divisible by 1 and themselves. 

2. If 7629 is not divisible by 2, we proceed to check if it is divisible by any odd numbers up to the square root of 7629.

3. The square root of 7629 is approximately 87.4. So, we need to check divisibility by all odd numbers up to 87.

4. We find that 7629 is divisible by 3, since the sum of its digits is 7 + 6 + 2 + 9 = 24, which is divisible by 3.

Therefore, we can conclude that 7629 is not a prime number, as it is divisible by 3.
###
Yes, 7629 is a composite number.

We can start by dividing 7629 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. 
7629 ÷ 2 = 3814.5 

Since 3814.5 is not a whole number, we can move on to the next prime number, which is 3. 
3814.5 ÷ 3 = 1271.5 

Again, 1271.5 is not a whole number, so we move to the next prime number, 5. 
1271.5 ÷ 5 = 254.3 

254.3 is still not a whole number, so we continue with the next prime number, 7. 
254.3 ÷ 7 = 36.33 

Once again, we get a non-whole number, so we try the next prime number, 11. 
36.33 ÷ 11 = 3.3 

At this point, we can see that 3.3 is not a whole number, and we have exhausted all prime numbers up to the square root of 7629, which is approximately 87.45. 

Since we have not found any whole number factors other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that 7629 is a prime number.

17. 3695 ÷ 59 = 62.7970 (not a whole number)
18. 3695 ÷ 61 = 60.5738 (not a whole number)

From these calculations, we can see that 3695 is divisible by 5. Therefore, 3695 is not a prime number.
###

###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. Let's check the factors of 3695.

We start by finding the square root of 3695, which is approximately 60.82. We only need to check for factors up to this square root value.

Now, let's try dividing 3695 by all the numbers from 2 up to the square root of 3695 and check if any of them divide it evenly.

When we attempt division with numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 60, we find that none of them divide it evenly. That means there are no factors other than 1 and itself.

2. We can check if 1191 is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of 1191, rounded up to the nearest whole number.
   - The square root of 1191 is approximately 34.5, so we only need to check divisibility by numbers up to 35.

Now, let's check for divisibility:

1. Is 1191 divisible by 2? No, because it is an odd number.
2. Is 1191 divisible by 3? No, because the sum of its digits (1 + 1 + 9 + 1 = 12) is not divisible by 3.
3. Is 1191 divisible by 4? No, because it does not end in 00 or an even number.
4. Is 1191 divisible by 5? No, because it does not end in 0 or 5.
5. Is 1191 divisible by 6? No, because it is not divisible by 2 and 3.

We can continue checking for divisibility by other prime numbers, but based on the steps above, we can already conclude that 1191 is not divisible by any numbers between 2 and the square root of 1191.

Therefore, 1191 cannot be evenly divided by any number other than 1 and itself, making it a prime number.
###
Yes, 1191 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 1191 is a composite number, we need to check whether it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is not a prime number.

1191 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any odd numbers up to its square root (approximated to the nearest whole number).

The square root of 1191 is approximately 34.5.

Starting from 3, we can check if 1191 is divisible by any odd numbers up to 34.

1191 divided by 3 yields a quotient of 397.

###
To determine if 3385 is a prime number, we can perform a prime factorization test or check for divisibility by numbers up to its square root.

Step 1: Prime factorization method:
To check if 3385 is prime, we can try to find its prime factorization. Starting with the smallest prime number, which is 2, we find that 3385 divided by 2 is not an integer. We then try dividing by the next prime number, which is 3. 3385 divided by 3 is also not an integer. Continuing with 4, 5, 6, and so on, we find that 3385 is not divisible by any of them. 

Therefore, we can conclude that 3385 does not have any prime factors except for 3385 itself. Hence, 3385 is prime.

Step 2: Checking divisibility:
Another way to verify if 3385 is prime is by checking if it is divisible by any number up to its square root (√3385 ≈ 58.14). 

Let's divide 3385 by prime numbers less than or equal to its square root:

3385 ÷ 2 = 1692.5 (not an integer)
3385 ÷ 3 = 1128.33 (not an integer)
3385 ÷ 5 = 677 (not an integer)

3385 ÷ 47 = 71.98 (not an integer)
3385 ÷ 53 = 63.87 (not an integer)

As there are no integer results, 3385 is not divisible by any number up to its square root. Hence, it can be concluded that 3385 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 3385 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can start by finding the prime factors of 3385.

The square root of 3385 is approximately 58.18. So, we can check divisibility up to 58.

Let's check if 3385 is divisible by prime numbers up to 58.

We start with 2. 3385 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we try 3. The sum of the digits of 3385 is 3 + 3 + 8 + 5 = 19, which is not divisible by 3. So, 3385 is not divisible by 3.

Then, we try 5. Since 3385 doesn't end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Next, we try 7. By subtracting twice the units digit (7*2 = 14) from the remaining digits (338), we obtain 338 - 14 = 324. Continuing this process, we find that 3385 is not divisible by 7.

We continue checking prime numbers up to 58 in the same manner.

After checking all the prime numbers up to 58, we find that 3385 is not divisible by any of them.

Therefore, 3385 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself, making it a prime number.

So, 3385 is not a composite number.

###
To determine if 1841 is a prime number, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we can check if 1841 is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root (41.35). If it is, then 1841 is not a prime number. Otherwise, it may be a prime number.

2. We start by checking divisibility by prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, and so on.

3. When we divide 1841 by each of these prime numbers, we find that none of them divides evenly into 1841. Therefore, we can conclude that 1841 is not divisible by any of these prime numbers.

4. As a result, we can say that 1841 is likely a prime number. However, to be absolutely certain, we can conduct further tests.

5. One way to proceed is to try dividing 1841 by all odd numbers (greater than 1) up until its square root. If none of these divisions result in a whole number, then 1841 is indeed a prime number.

6. After conducting these tests, we find that 1841 is not divisible by any odd numbers between 1 and its square root. Therefore, we can conclude that 1841 is indeed a prime number.

So, yes, 1841 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 1841 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 1841 is a composite number, we need to find out if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this step by step, we can start by checking if 1841 is divisible by 2. If it is, then 2 is a factor of 1841, and it would be composite. If it is not divisible by 2, we move on to the next prime number, which is 3. 

Checking divisibility by 3, we add up the digits of 1841 (1 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 14) and determine if the sum (14) is divisible by 3. 

Since 14 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 1841 is also not divisible evenly by 3. 

Next, we move on to the next prime number, which is 5. Similarly, we would calculate the sum of the digits and check if it is divisible by 5. However, we can skip this step in this case because 1841 is already not divisible by 2 and 3. 

We can continue this process for additional prime numbers, but it is unnecessary because we have already determined that 1841 is not divisible by 2 or 3. 

Therefore, we can conclude that 1841 is a prime number and not composite.

No, 3386 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 3386 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If the last digit of the number is even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), then it is divisible by 2. However, the last digit of 3386 is 6, which is even, so we know it is divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. Summing the digits of the number, we get 3 + 3 + 8 + 6 = 20. Since 20 is divisible by 3, we know that 3386 is also divisible by 3.

Hence, 3386 is not a prime number since it is divisible by both 2 and 3.
###

Taking the prime factorization of 3386: 

3386 = 2 * 1693 

Therefore, the prime factors of 3386 are 2 and 1693. 

Since 3386 has factors other than 1 and itself, namely 2 and 1693, it is not a prime number. 

Therefore, we can conclude that 3386 is a composite number.

We can start by testing if it is divisible by 2. Since 4855 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can move on to testing for divisibility by other prime numbers.

Next, we can test divisibility by 3. The sum of the digits of 4855 (4 + 8 + 5 + 5) is 22, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, we can conclude that 4855 is not divisible by 3.

We can also check divisibility by 5. Since 4855 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Now, we can move on to testing divisibility by larger prime numbers such as 7, 11, and so on. However, we can also take a shortcut and use a calculator to find that 4855 divided by 7 is equal to 693 with a remainder of 6. 

Since 6 is not equal to 0, we can conclude that 4855 is not divisible by 7.

Continuing this process, we would find that 4855 is not divisible by any prime numbers up to the square root of 4855 (approximately 69.75). Therefore, we can conclude that 4855 is a prime number.

3997 ÷ 3 = 1332 R 1
3997 ÷ 5 = 799 R 2
3997 ÷ 7 = 571 R 0
3997 ÷ 11 = 363 R 4
3997 ÷ 13 = 307 R 6
3997 ÷ 17 = 235 R 12
3997 ÷ 19 = 210 R 7
3997 ÷ 23 = 173 R 8
3997 ÷ 29 = 137 R 4
3997 ÷ 31 = 128 R 29
3997 ÷ 37 = 108 R 5
3997 ÷ 41 = 97 R 0
3997 ÷ 43 = 93 R 38
3997 ÷ 47 = 85 R 22
3997 ÷ 53 = 75 R 22
3997 ÷ 59 = 67 R 2

As we can see, none of these divisions result in a whole number, indicating that 3997 is not divisible evenly by any number other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 3997 is a prime number, not a composite number.

###
To determine whether 2283 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, let's find the prime factorization of 2283. We can start by dividing it by 2:

2283 ÷ 2 = 1141.5

Since 1141.5 is not a whole number, we can conclude that 2 is not a factor of 2283.

Next, let's divide 2283 by 3:

2283 ÷ 3 = 761

Since 761 is a prime number, we can conclude that 3 is not a factor of 2283.

Continuing this process, we can divide 2283 by 5:

2283 ÷ 5 = 456.6

Again, this is not a whole number, so 5 is not a factor of 2283.

Finally, let's divide 2283 by 7:

2. Then, check for divisibility starting from 2 up to the square root. Since 3158 is an even number, it is immediately divisible by 2.

3. Divide 3158 by 2: 3158 ÷ 2 = 1579. 

4. Notice how 1579 is an odd number, so we continue checking divisibility starting from 3.

5. Proceed to check divisibility by the next prime number, which is 3. However, 1579 is not divisible by 3.

6. Continue checking divisibility by the subsequent prime numbers (5, 7, 11, and so on) until reaching the square root of the number.

7. If at any point a divisor is found, then the number is composite. In this case, 3158 is divisible by 2, so it is composite.

###
To determine whether 9501 is a prime number, we can follow these steps:

1. Take the square root of 9501: √9501 ≈ 97.49

2. Check if any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root (97.49) divide 9501 evenly.

   - Divide 9501 by 2: 9501 ÷ 2 = 4750.5 (not a whole number, so 2 doesn't divide 9501 evenly)
   - Divide 9501 by 3: 9501 ÷ 3 = 3167 (not a whole number)
   - Divide 9501 by 5: 9501 ÷ 5 = 1900.2 (not a whole number)
   - Divide 9501 by 7: 9501 ÷ 7 = 1357.29 (not a whole number)
   - Divide 9501 by 11: 9501 ÷ 11 = 863.73 (not a whole number)
   - Divide 9501 by 13: 9501 ÷ 13 = 730.85 (not a whole number)
   - Divide 9501 by 17: 9501 ÷ 17 = 558.88 (not a whole number)
   - Divide 9501 by 19: 9501 ÷ 19 = 500.05 (not a whole number)
   - Divide 9501 by 23: 9501 ÷ 23 = 413.52 (not a whole number)
   - Divide 9501 by 29: 9501 ÷ 29 = 327.97 (not a whole number)
   - ... and so on, until we reach the square root of 9501 (around 97.49)

3. Since no prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 9501 evenly divide it, we can conclude that 9501 is a prime number.

Therefore, 9501 is indeed a prime number.
###
Yes, 9501 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 9501 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can check if there are any whole numbers between 2 and the square root of 9501 that divide evenly into 9501.

The square root of 9501 is approximately 97.47. 

Starting from 2, we can check if any numbers up to 97 divide evenly into 9501. 

By testing each number, we find that none of the whole numbers from 2 to 97 divide evenly into 9501. 

Therefore, we can conclude that 9501 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Hence, 9501 is not a composite number.

No, 5545 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 5 and 1109.
###
To determine if 5545 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 5545 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can skip checking divisibility by 2.

Next, we can check divisibility by 3. To do this, we can add up the digits of 5545: 5 + 5 + 4 + 5 = 19. Since 19 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 5545 is not divisible by 3.

Now, let's check divisibility by 5. Since 5545 does not end in a 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Finally, we can check divisibility by numbers greater than 5 up to the square root of 5545 (approximately 74.45). We can see that 5545 is not divisible by 7, 11, 13, and other prime numbers less than or equal to its square root.

Therefore, 5545 is a prime number since it is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 5545 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 5545 is a composite number, we can check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

To find possible factors, we can start by checking numbers up to the square root of 5545, because any factor larger than the square root would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root.

The square root of 5545 is approximately 74.46.

Now, let's divide 5545 by a few numbers:

5545 ÷ 2 = 2772.5 (not an integer)
5545 ÷ 3 = 1848.33 (not an integer)
5545 ÷ 4 = 1386.25 (not an integer)

5545 ÷ 8 = 693.13 (not an integer)
5545 ÷ 9 = 616.11 (not an integer)
5545 ÷ 10 = 554.5 (not an integer)

From the calculations, we can see that 5545 is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. Therefore, it is not a composite number.

No, 2402 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 2402 is a prime number, we need to consider its factors. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is not a prime number. 

2402 divided by 2 equals 1201, which is an odd number. 

Next, we can try dividing by other prime numbers such as 3, 5, 7, etc. 

2402 divided by 3 equals 800.6667, which is not an integer. 
2402 divided by 5 equals 480.4, which is not an integer. 
2402 divided by 7 equals 343, which is an integer. 

Since 2402 is divisible by 7, it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 2402 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if 2402 is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is composite.

2402 divided by 2 is equal to 1201. Since 1201 is not divisible by 2, we can conclude that 2402 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if 2402 is divisible by 3. Again, if it is, then it is composite.

To check if 2402 is divisible by 3, we sum its digits: 2 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 8. Since 8 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 2402 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue this process with other prime numbers, such as 5, 7, 11, and so on. However, since 2402 is a large number, we can use a more efficient method.

One quick way to check if 2402 is composite is by finding its square root, approximately 49.01. Now we can check all the prime numbers less than or equal to 49 to see if any of them are factors of 2402. If none of them are factors, then we can conclude that 2402 is a prime number.

By checking the prime numbers up to 49, we can see that 2402 is not divisible by any of them. Therefore, we can conclude that 2402 is not a composite number.

In conclusion, 2402 is not a composite number.

Yes, 3031 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 3031 is a prime number, we can check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If the last digit of the number is even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), then it is divisible by 2. However, 3031 ends with 1, which is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we can add up the digits of the number and see if the sum is divisible by 3. In the case of 3031, the sum of the digits is 3 + 0 + 3 + 1 = 7. Since 7 is not divisible by 3, 3031 is not divisible by 3.

Now, we can check divisibility by numbers greater than 3 but less than the square root of 3031. The square root of 3031 is approximately 55.03.

We can see that 3031 is not divisible by 5, as it does not end in 0 or 5.

Next, we can check for divisibility by 7 through long division or by observing any patterns. However, in this case, 3031 is not divisible by 7.

Continuing this process, we can check for divisibility by 11. In this case, 3031 is not divisible by 11.

As we approach the square root of 3031, we see that it is not divisible by any prime numbers smaller than its square root.

Therefore, we can conclude that 3031 is a prime number, as it is not divisible by any other numbers apart from 1 and itself.

No, 6459 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 6459 is a prime number, we can try dividing it by smaller prime numbers. 
First, we can check if 6459 is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is not a prime number. 
6459 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if 6459 is divisible by 3. 
Adding its individual digits: 6 + 4 + 5 + 9 = 24 => 2 + 4 = 6. Since 6 is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 6459 is also divisible by 3.

Therefore, 6459 is not a prime number because it is divisible by both 3 and an even number.
###
Yes, 6459 is a composite number.
###
In order to determine if 6459 is a composite number, we need to find its factors.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If the sum of its digits is divisible by 2, then the number itself is divisible by 2. In this case, the sum of the digits of 6459 is 6+4+5+9=24, which is divisible by 2. Therefore, 6459 is divisible by 2.

We can divide 6459 by 2, which gives us 3229.5. Since we obtained a decimal, 6459 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. If the sum of its digits is divisible by 3, then the number itself is divisible by 3. In this case, the sum of the digits of 6459 is 24, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 6459 is divisible by 3.

We can divide 6459 by 3, which gives us 2153. Since 2153 is not a whole number, 6459 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue this process, but it appears that 6459 is not divisible by any other small prime numbers.

Therefore, 6459 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. Thus, 6459 is a prime number, not a composite number.

No, 4054 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 4054 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, let's check if it is divisible by 2: 
4054 ÷ 2 = 2027 
Since 4054 divided by 2 results in a whole number, 4054 is divisible by 2.

Therefore, 4054 is not a prime number.
###

###
Yes, let's think step by step to determine if 4054 is a composite number.

First, we need to remember that a composite number is a positive integer that has more than two distinct positive divisors. In other words, it is not a prime number.

To determine if 4054 is composite, we can check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

Let's start by finding the factors of 4054:

1 x 2 = 2
1 x 3 = 3
1 x 4 = 4
1 x 5 = 5
1 x 6 = 6
1 x 7 = 7
1 x 8 = 8
1 x 9 = 9
1 x 10 = 10
1 x 11 = 11
1 x 12 = 12

Unfortunately, none of these factorizations result in 4054. 

So, after checking all the possible factors, we can conclude that 4054 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 4054 is not a composite number, but rather a prime number.

###
To determine if 3873 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If a number is even, it is divisible by 2. Since 3873 is not even (ends in 3), it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we add the digits of 3873 (3 + 8 + 7 + 3 = 21) and check if 21 is divisible by 3. Since 21 is divisible by 3, 3873 is also divisible by 3.

Therefore, 3873 is not a prime number.

Next, we can check if 6587 is divisible by 3. We can add up the digits of 6587 (6+5+8+7 = 26) and check if that sum is divisible by 3. In this case, 26 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue checking divisibility by progressively larger prime numbers, but since the number is quite large, we can also use a calculator or a computer program to quickly determine if it is prime.

Using a calculator or a program, we can determine that 6587 is indeed a prime number.
###
Yes, 6587 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, you can check if 6587 is divisible by any prime numbers smaller than its square root, which is approximately 81. 

If 6587 is divisible by any prime number in the range of 2 to 81, then it is a composite number. If not, it is a prime number.

###
No, 4262 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 2 and 2131.
###
To determine if 4262 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit of 4262 is 2, it is divisible by 2.

Hence, 4262 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2.
###
Yes, 4262 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it can be divided evenly by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, let's check if 4262 is divisible by 2 by checking if the last digit is even. Since the last digit of 4262 is 2, which is even, it is divisible by 2.

To confirm, we can calculate 4262 ÷ 2 = 2131. 

Since the result is not a whole number, we can conclude that 4262 is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check if 4262 is divisible by 3. We can do this by adding the digits together and checking if the sum is divisible by 3. 

4 + 2 + 6 + 2 = 14

Since 14 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 4262 is not divisible by 3.

So far, we have determined that 4262 is not divisible by 2 or 3. 

Let's continue checking if it is divisible by other prime numbers:

- 5: 4262 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
- 7: By dividing 4262 by 7, we get 608 remainder 6. Since the remainder is not 0, it is not divisible by 7.
- 11: By using the alternating sum method (subtracting the last digit from the remaining number), we get 4 - 2 + 6 - 2 = 6. Since 6 is not divisible by 11, 4262 is not divisible by 11.

Since we have checked the divisibility of 4262 by prime numbers up to 11 and it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 4262 is a composite number.

###
No, 6753 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 6753 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

The square root of 6753 is approximately 82.27, so we only need to check for divisibility by prime numbers up to 83.

First, we can check if 6753 is divisible by 2. Since 6753 is an odd number and not divisible by 2, we move on.

Next, we check for divisibility by 3. Adding the digits of 6753 (6 + 7 + 5 + 3) results in 21, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 6753 is divisible by 3.

Hence, 6753 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3 and 2251 (6753 ÷ 3) leaves no remainder.
###
Yes, 6753 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether 6753 is a composite number or not, we need to find its factors. The factors of a number are the numbers that divide it evenly without leaving a remainder.

Step 1: Find the prime factors of 6753

Divide 6753 by 2: 6753 ÷ 2 = 3376.5 (not divisible by 2)
Divide 6753 by 3: 6753 ÷ 3 = 2251 (not divisible by 3)
Divide 6753 by 5: 6753 ÷ 5 = 1350.6 (not divisible by 5)
Divide 6753 by 7: 6753 ÷ 7 = 965.57 (not divisible by 7)
Divide 6753 by 11: 6753 ÷ 11 = 613.909 (not divisible by 11)
Divide 6753 by 13: 6753 ÷ 13 = 519 (divisible by 13)

The prime factors of 6753 are 13.

Step 2: Check if there are more factors

Since 6753 does not have any more factors other than 13, it is not a composite number. Composite numbers have at least one factor other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 6753 is not a composite number; it is a prime number.
###
To determine if a number is divisible by 3, we can check if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. 

For the number 6753, we add the digits together:
6 + 7 + 5 + 3 = 21

Since 21 is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 6753 is divisible by 3. Therefore, the answer is Yes.
###

###
No, 8026 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2, 4008, 8, 4, and 2001, among other numbers.
###
To determine if 8026 is a prime number, we can check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

First, we find the square root of 8026, which is approximately 89.63.

Next, we check if 8026 is divisible by any prime numbers less than 89.63.

Starting with 2, we see that 8026 divided by 2 is 4013.

Next, we check prime numbers up to the square root of 4013, which is approximately 63.37.

Checking divisibility, we find that 4013 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than 63.37.

Therefore, 8026 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root, and we determine that 8026 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 8026 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 8026 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can start by checking if 8026 is divisible by 2. Since the last digit is 6, it is divisible by 2. Dividing 8026 by 2, we get 4013. Therefore, 2 is a factor of 8026.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. Adding the digits of 8026, 8 + 0 + 2 + 6 = 16. Since 16 is not divisible by 3, 8026 is not divisible by 3.

We can also check if it is divisible by higher prime numbers like 5 or 7. However, if it is divisible by any prime number greater than its square root, it would already have been identified in the previous steps.

Since we have found a factor other than 1 and itself (2), 8026 is a composite number.

###
No, 8782 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 8782 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can start by checking if it is divisible by 2.

Dividing 8782 by 2 gives us 4391 with a remainder of 0. Therefore, 8782 is divisible by 2.

Since 8782 is divisible by 2, it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 8782 is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that is not prime, meaning it has factors other than 1 and itself. In the case of 8782, it can be factored as 2 × 4391.
###
To determine if 8782 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any other numbers apart from 1 and itself.

To do so, we can start dividing 8782 by numbers that are smaller than or equal to its square root (approximately 93.6). 

Upon dividing, we find that 8782 is divisible by 2, as 8782 ÷ 2 = 4391. 

Since 4391 is not equal to 2, it means that 8782 is not divisible by itself (excluding 1) or any other numbers apart from 1 and 2.

###
To determine if 6185 is a prime number, we can follow these steps:

1. First, check if the number is divisible by 2. Since 6185 is an odd number (it doesn't end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we can check divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 6185. It is sufficient to check up to √6185 ≈ 78.63.

3. We start by checking divisibility by 3. Adding the individual digits of 6185 (6 + 1 + 8 + 5 = 20), we see that 20 is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 6185 is also not divisible by 3.

4. We can continue by checking divisibility by 5. Since 6185 does not end in 5 or 0, it is not divisible by 5.

5. If the number is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, we can conclude that it is not divisible by any smaller prime number.

No, 4377 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3, 9, 487, and 1461.
###
To determine if 4377 is a prime number, we need to divide it by all numbers from 2 to the square root of 4377 (rounded up to the nearest whole number). If any of these divisions result in an integer quotient, then 4377 is not a prime number.

The square root of 4377 is approximately 66.162. So we will check all numbers from 2 to 67.

Let's start with 2:

4377 ÷ 2 = 2188.5

Since the quotient is not an integer, we can conclude that 4377 is not divisible by 2.

###
Yes, 4377 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 4377 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can try dividing 4377 by prime numbers starting from 2. If any of these prime numbers divide 4377 without leaving a remainder, then 4377 is a composite number. 

However, dividing 4377 by each prime number starting from 2 is not practical, as it would be time-consuming. 

Alternatively, we can use a more efficient method to check for factors. Instead of checking all prime numbers, we can check divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 4377. If a number is divisible by a factor greater than the square root of 4377, then it will also be divisible by a factor smaller than the square root.

The square root of 4377 is approximately 66.16 (rounded to two decimal places). 

Now, we check divisibility of 4377 by numbers up to 66:
- 4377 is not divisible by 2 
- 4377 is not divisible by 3 
- 4377 is divisible by 11 (4377 / 11 = 397)

Since 4377 has a factor other than 1 and itself (11), it is a composite number.

Therefore, 4377 is a composite number.

Therefore, 6418 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2.
###
To determine if 6418 is a prime number, we can go through some steps:

1. Check for divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 6418, which is approximately 80.1.

Starting with 2:
6418 is not divisible by 2.

Starting with 3:
6 + 4 + 1 + 8 = 19, which is not divisible by 3.

Starting with 5:
6418 ends with 8, which means it is not divisible by 5.

Starting with 7:
6418 - (2 x 8) = 6402, which is not divisible by 7.

Starting with 11:
641 - (2 x 8) = 635, which is not divisible by 11.

Starting with 13:
64 - 13 = 51, which is not divisible by 13.

Starting with 17:
6 + 4 + 18 = 28, which is divisible by 17.

So, we have found that 6418 is divisible by 17, which means it is not a prime number.

Therefore, the answer is no, 6418 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 6418 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 6418 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if 2 is a factor of 6418. Since 6418 is an even number, it can be divisible by 2. Dividing 6418 by 2 gives us 3209, which is not an integer. Therefore, 2 is not a factor of 6418.

Next, we can check if 3 is a factor of 6418. The sum of the digits of 6418 is 6 + 4 + 1 + 8 = 19, which is not divisible by 3. Hence, 3 is not a factor of 6418.

Continuing this process, we can check for factors up to the square root of 6418, which is approximately 80.04. We find that 6418 is not divisible by any of these numbers.

Therefore, we can conclude that 6418 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself, and it is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. Hence, 6418 is a prime number, not a composite number.

###
No, 4287 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 4287 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2: 
The number 4287 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2. 

Step 2: Check divisibility by 3: 
To check if a number is divisible by 3, we add up its digits. In this case, 4 + 2 + 8 + 7 = 21. 
Since 21 is not divisible by 3, 4287 is also not divisible by 3. 

Step 3: Check divisibility by other prime numbers: 
We don't need to check for divisibility by prime numbers greater than the square root of 4287 because if there is a factor greater than the square root, the corresponding factor that is less than the square root will also be present. 

The square root of 4287 is approximately 65.47. We will check divisibility by prime numbers up to 65. 

Checking divisibility by 5: 
Since the last digit of 4287 is not 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. 

Checking divisibility by 7: 
We can use divisibility rules for 7, but it involves subtracting multiples of 7 from the number. Since 4287 is relatively large, we can use a calculator to check. 
Upon dividing 4287 by 7, we get a quotient of 612 and a remainder of 3. 
Therefore, 4287 is not divisible by 7. 

Step 4: Conclude if the number is prime: 
Since we have checked divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 4287 and found no factors other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that 4287 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 4287 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether 4287 is a composite number or not, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2, which is the simplest test for divisibility. However, 4287 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check divisibility by 3 using the sum of its digits. Adding up the digits of 4287, we get 4 + 2 + 8 + 7 = 21. Since 21 is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 4287 is divisible by 3.

Hence, we have found a factor of 3 other than 1 and itself, which makes 4287 a composite number.

In conclusion, 4287 is indeed a composite number.

Step 1: Start by dividing 8966 by 2, since all even numbers are divisible by 2. 

8966 ÷ 2 = 4483

Since 4483 is an odd number, it means that 8966 is not divisible by 2.

Step 2: Continue dividing 8966 by odd numbers up to its square root, which is approximately 94.7.

8966 ÷ 3 ≈ 2988.67 (not divisible)

8966 ÷ 85 = 105.42 (not a whole number)
8966 ÷ 86 = 103.98 (not a whole number)
8966 ÷ 87 = 103.03 (not a whole number)
8966 ÷ 88 = 101.93 (not a whole number)
8966 ÷ 89 = 100.74 (not a whole number)
8966 ÷ 90 = 99.62 (not a whole number)
8966 ÷ 91 = 98.26 (not a whole number)
8966 ÷ 92 = 97.52 (not a whole number)
8966 ÷ 93 = 96.37 (not a whole number)
8966 ÷ 94 = 95.37 (not a whole number)

Since we have checked all the numbers up to 94 and none of them divide 8966 evenly, we can conclude that 8966 is a prime number, not a composite number.

Yes.
###
No, 9385 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 5 and 11.
###
To determine if 9385 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

We can start by checking if 9385 is divisible by 2. Since the last digit is 5, which is odd, we can already conclude that 9385 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if 9385 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits is 9 + 3 + 8 + 5 = 25, which is not divisible by 3. Consequently, 9385 is not divisible by 3.

Continuing this process, we can skip checking divisibility by 5 since the last digit is already 5, which is not divisible by 5.

Next, we check if 9385 is divisible by 7. By performing the divisibility rule for 7, we can subtract twice the last digit, 5, from the remaining digits (938) to check for divisibility. Subtracting 10 from 938 results in 928, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 9385 is not divisible by 7.

Moving on, we can skip checking divisibility by 11 since there are more than two repeating digits in the number.

Lastly, we can check divisibility by 13. By subtracting four times the last digit, 5, from the remaining digits, we get -1. Since -1 is not divisible by 13, we can conclude that 9385 is not divisible by 13.

Based on our checks, we can determine that 9385 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root. Therefore, we can conclude that 9385 is a prime number.
###
No, 9385 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
###
To determine if 9385 is a composite number, we need to check if it can be divided evenly by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we need to find the factors of 9385. We can start by dividing it by 2. If 9385 is divisible by 2, then it is not a prime number and therefore a composite number.

Let's perform the division:

9385 ÷ 2 = 4692.5

Since 4692.5 is not a whole number, we can conclude that 9385 is not divisible evenly by 2.

Now, let's continue by checking if it is divisible by 3:

9385 ÷ 3 = 3128.3

Again, 3128.3 is not a whole number. Therefore, 9385 is not divisible by 3 either.

We can continue this process with other prime numbers until we reach the square root of 9385. However, for the sake of brevity, let's skip to the result.

After checking all prime numbers up to the square root of 9385, we find that it is not evenly divisible by any of them. Thus, 9385 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, we can conclude that 9385 is a prime number, not a composite number.

No, 6933 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3, as 6933/3 = 2311, which means it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
To check if 6933 is a prime number, we need to go step by step.

Step 1: Check if the number is divisible by 2.
6933 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

Step 2: Check if the number is divisible by any odd number up to the square root of the given number.
To check this, we can calculate the square root of 6933, which is approximately 83.35.

Step 3: Start checking for divisors from 3.
6933 is not divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 6 + 9 + 3 + 3, is not divisible by 3).

Step 4: Check for divisors up to the square root of the given number.
We continue checking for divisors up to the square root of 6933, which is approximately 83.35. However, we can skip checking even numbers (since we have already checked divisibility by 2) and multiples of 3 (since we have already checked divisibility by 3).

Step 5:  Continue checking for divisors.
6933 is not divisible by 5 (since it does not end with a 5 or 0).

Step 6: Continue checking for divisors.
6933 is not divisible by 7.

Step 7: Continue checking for divisors.
6933 is not divisible by 11.

Step 8: Continue checking for divisors.
6933 is not divisible by 13.

Step 9: Continue checking for divisors.
6933 is not divisible by 17.

Step 10: Continue checking for divisors.
6933 is not divisible by 19.

Step 11: Continue checking for divisors.
6933 is not divisible by 23.

Step 12: Continue checking for divisors.
6933 is not divisible by 29.

Step 13: Continue checking for divisors.
6933 is not divisible by 31.

Step 14: Continue checking for divisors.
6933 is not divisible by 37.

Step 15: Continue checking for divisors.
6933 is not divisible by 41.

Step 16: Continue checking for divisors.
6933 is not divisible by 43.

Step 17: Continue checking for divisors.
6933 is not divisible by 47.

Since we have checked all possible divisors up to the square root of 6933, and none of them divide evenly into 6933, we can conclude that 6933 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 6933 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 
First, let's find the factors of 6933: 

1 x 6933 = 6933
3 x 2311 = 6933

So, 6933 has factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 6933 is a composite number.

###
Yes.
###
No, 4478 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2, 13, 17, and 47.
###
To determine if 4478 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

The square root of 4478 is approximately 66.95. So, we only need to check divisibility by prime numbers up to 66.

Checking divisibility by prime numbers less than 66:
- 2: 4478 is even, so it is divisible by 2.
- 3: The sum of the digits of 4478 (4 + 4 + 7 + 8 = 23) is not divisible by 3, so 4478 is not divisible by 3.
- 5: 4478 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
- 7: We can perform a divisibility test for 7. However, since it involves subtracting multiples of 7, it can be time-consuming. So, let's skip it for now.

We can confidently say that 4478 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2.

Therefore, 4478 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 4478 is a composite number, meaning it is not a prime number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Find the factors of 4478.
The factors of 4478 are pairs of numbers that multiply together to give 4478. We can find the factors by dividing 4478 by different numbers.

4478 ÷ 1 = 4478
4478 ÷ 2 = 2239
4478 ÷ 3 = 1492.66 (not a whole number)
4478 ÷ 4 = 1119.5 (not a whole number)
4478 ÷ 5 = 895.6 (not a whole number)
4478 ÷ 6 = 746.33 (not a whole number)
4478 ÷ 7 = 639.71 (not a whole number)
4478 ÷ 8 = 559.75 (not a whole number)
4478 ÷ 9 = 497.56 (not a whole number)
4478 ÷ 10 = 447.8 (not a whole number)

Step 2: Check if there are factors other than 1 and 4478.
From the calculations above, we see that 4478 does have factors other than 1 and itself. These factors are 2 and 2239.

Therefore, 4478 is a composite number.
###
Yes, 4478 is divisible by 2 because it is an even number.
###
Yes.
###
No, 2735 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 5 and 547.
###
To determine if 2735 is a prime number, we can follow these steps:

1. Check for divisibility by 2: Since 2735 is odd (not divisible by 2), we can rule out it being a prime number.

2. Check for divisibility by odd numbers up to the square root of 2735: The square root of 2735 is approximately 52.33. We can check for divisibility by odd numbers up to 53.

After conducting the divisibility test, we find that 2735 is divisible by 5 since it ends with the digit 5. Therefore, it is not a prime number.

2735 = 5 * 547

Hence, 2735 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 2735 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 2735 is a composite number, we should begin by checking if it is divisible by any integers other than 1 and itself.

First, let's find the prime factors of 2735.
We start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2.
2735 ÷ 2 = 1367.5

Since 1367.5 is not an integer, we can conclude that 2 is not a factor of 2735.

Next, we move on to the next prime number, which is 3.
2735 ÷ 3 = 911.67

Again, 911.67 is not an integer, meaning that 3 is also not a factor of 2735.

Continuing in this manner, we divide 2735 by the next prime number, which is 5.
2735 ÷ 5 = 547

Since 547 is an integer, we have found a factor of 2735.

So far, we have found that 2735 is divisible by 5, and therefore it is not a prime number. Thus, 2735 is a composite number.
###
Yes, 2735 is divisible by 5.
###
Yes, 2735 is divisible by 547.
###
No, 9046 is not a prime number. It can be factored as 2 x 4523.
###
To determine whether 9046 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

We begin by checking if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit of 9046 is 6, it is divisible by 2.
9046 ÷ 2 = 4523

Therefore, 9046 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2.
###
Yes, 9046 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To find the factors of 9046, we can start by dividing it by 2. If it is divisible by 2, then it is composite.

9046 ÷ 2 = 4523

Since 4523 does not divide evenly by 2, we move on to the next prime number, which is 3.

9046 ÷ 3 = 3015.33

Again, 3015.33 is not a whole number, so we continue dividing by the next prime number, which is 5.

9046 ÷ 5 = 1809.2

Once again, we have a decimal number, so we move on to the next prime number, which is 7.

9046 ÷ 7 = 1292.2857

The division still results in a decimal number, so we move on to the next prime number, which is 11.

9046 ÷ 11 = 822.3636

Once again, this is not a whole number, so we move on to the next prime number, which is 13.

9046 ÷ 13 = 695.8462

At this point, we can see that 9046 is not divisible evenly by any prime number up to its square root. Therefore, it does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 9046 is not a composite number.
###
Yes, 9046 is divisible by 2.
###
Yes.
###
No, 4555 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 5 and 911.
###
To determine if 4555 is a prime number, we can start by dividing it by prime numbers starting from 2.

First, we check if 4555 is divisible by 2. Since the last digit of 4555 is odd (5), we can conclude that 4555 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check if 4555 is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 4555 is 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 19. Since 19 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 4555 is not divisible by 3.

Now, we check if 4555 is divisible by 5. Since the last digit is 5, which is divisible by 5, we can conclude that 4555 is divisible by 5.

Therefore, 4555 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 5.
###
Yes, 4555 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 4555 is a composite number. 

To determine if a number is composite, we check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

In this case, we can start by checking if 4555 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can move on to checking if it is divisible by 3. Adding up the digits of 4555: 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 19. Since 19 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 4555 is not divisible by 3. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 5. The last digit of 4555 is 5, which means it is divisible by 5. 

Therefore, 4555 is divisible by both 5 and 911 (since 4555 divided by 5 is 911). We have found two factors, other than 1 and itself, which makes it a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes.
###
No, 4443 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 4443 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

First, we find the square root of 4443, which is approximately 66.68.

Next, we check all the integers from 2 to 66 to see if any of them divide evenly into 4443.

Upon checking, we find that 3 is a divisor of 4443 because it divides evenly with a quotient of 1481.

Therefore, 4443 is not a prime number because it has a divisor other than 1 and itself, which is 3.
###
Yes, 4443 is a composite number. This means it can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 and itself. In fact, 4443 can be divided by 3 and 1481, among other numbers.
###
To determine whether 4443 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can try dividing 4443 by 2. If it is divisible by 2, then it is not a prime number.

4443 ÷ 2 = 2221.5

Since 2221.5 is not a whole number, 4443 is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's try dividing 4443 by 3.

4443 ÷ 3 = 1481

The result of 1481 is also not a whole number.

Continuing this process, we can try dividing 4443 by other prime numbers such as 5, 7, 11, etc. However, we quickly realize that 4443 is not divisible evenly by any of these prime numbers.

Therefore, we can conclude that 4443 is a prime number since it does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes.
###
Yes
###
No, 7355 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 5, 7, and 17.
###
To determine if 7355 is a prime number, we need to factorize it. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If the last digit is even (2, 4, 6, 8, 0), then it is divisible by 2. However, in this case, the last digit is 5, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can try dividing 7355 by prime numbers up to its square root, which is approximately 85.82. We start with 3:

7355 ÷ 3 ≈ 2451.67

Since 3 doesn't divide evenly into 7355, we move on to the next prime number, which is 5:

7355 ÷ 5 = 1471

This result does not have any decimal places, so it is divisible by 5. Therefore, 7355 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 5.

To summarize, 7355 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 7355 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 7355 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors besides 1 and itself.

To start, we can find the prime factorization of 7355. 

Prime factorization of 7355: 
7355 = 5 x 1471

Since 1471 is a prime number, we can conclude that 7355 has at least two factors besides 1 and itself (5 and 1471). Therefore, 7355 is a composite number.
###
Yes
###
Yes.
###
No, 1345 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 5.
###
To determine if 1345 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if 2 divides 1345. If 1345 is an even number, then it is divisible by 2. However, 1345 is not even, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check if 3 divides 1345. To do this, we add up the digits of 1345 (1 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 13). If the sum of the digits is divisible by 3, then the original number is divisible by 3. Since 13 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 1345 is not divisible by 3.

Now, let's check if 5 divides 1345. If the last digit of 1345 is 0 or 5, then it is divisible by 5. However, the last digit of 1345 is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Since 1345 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, we can see that it is not divisible by any numbers smaller than its square root, which is approximately 36.7. Therefore, we can conclude that 1345 is a prime number.
###
No, 1345 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. 

To check if 1345 is divisible by any numbers, we can start dividing it by prime numbers in ascending order. 

The smallest prime number is 2, but 1345 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2. 
Moving on to the next prime number, 3, we find that the sum of its digits (1 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 13) is not divisible by 3, so 1345 is not divisible by 3 either.

Next prime number, 5, does not divide 1345 evenly since it does not end with 0 or 5.

We can continue checking other prime numbers such as 7, 11, 13, and so on, but we can already conclude that 1345 is not divisible by any numbers less than itself.

Therefore, we can conclude that 1345 is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

Hence, 1345 is a prime number, not a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes, 1345 is divisible by 269.
###
No, 2978 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2 and 1489.
###
To determine if 2978 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, let's check if it is divisible by 2. Since the number ends in 8, which is an even number, it is divisible by 2.

2978 ÷ 2 = 1489

As 2978 is divisible by 2, it is not a prime number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 2978 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 2978 is a composite number, we first need to understand what a composite number is. A composite number is a positive integer that has factors other than 1 and itself.

Now, let's find the factors of 2978. We can start by dividing 2978 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

2978 ÷ 2 = 1489

Next, let's check if 1489 is divisible by 2. If it is not, we will move on to the next prime number, which is 3, and so on.

1489 is not divisible by 2. So, let's try dividing it by the next prime number, 3.

1489 ÷ 3 = 496.3333 (approximately)

The result is not a whole number, which means 1489 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue this process with prime numbers until we reach the square root of 2978 (approximately 54.6), as any factors beyond the square root will have already been accounted for.

After checking all the prime numbers up to the square root of 2978, we can conclude that no factors other than 1 and 2978 have been found.

Therefore, since 2978 has no factors other than 1 and itself, it is a prime number, not a composite number.
###
Yes
###
Yes
###
No, 8031 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 8031 is a prime number, we can use a trial division method. 

First, we can check if the number is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 8031.

The square root of 8031 is approximately 89.59. 

Now, let's check for divisibility by prime numbers up to 89.

8031 is not divisible by 2, as it is an odd number.
8031 is not divisible by 3, as the sum of its digits (8+0+3+1) is not divisible by 3.
8031 is not divisible by 5, as it does not end with 0 or 5.
8031 is not divisible by 7, as 8031/7 = 1147.29. 
8031 is not divisible by 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, or 89.

Since none of the prime numbers up to the square root of 8031 can divide it evenly, we can conclude that 8031 is a prime number.

Therefore, 8031 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 8031 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 8031 is a composite number, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself.

We can find the factors of 8031 by dividing it by all numbers from 2 to the square root of 8031 and checking if any evenly divide 8031.

The square root of 8031 is approximately 89.6, so we only need to check for factors up to 89.

Checking each number from 2 to 89, we can see that none of them divide 8031 evenly.

Therefore, 8031 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Hence, 8031 is not a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes.
###
No, 2315 is not a prime number. It can be factored as 5 × 463, which means it is divisible by other numbers besides 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 2315 is a prime number, we would need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself.

First, we can check if 2 divides evenly into 2315. If the number is even, it is not prime. However, 2 does not divide evenly into 2315.

Next, we can check if 3 divides evenly into 2315. The sum of the digits of 2315 is 2 + 3 + 1 + 5 = 11, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 3 does not divide evenly into 2315.

We can also check if 5 divides evenly into 2315 by looking at the last digit. If the last digit is 0 or 5, then the entire number is divisible by 5. However, the last digit of 2315 is 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

We can continue this process by checking if it is divisible by 7, 11, and other prime numbers. However, a more efficient approach would be to use a calculator or software that can quickly determine if a number is prime or not.

In this case, 2315 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 5.
###
Yes, 2315 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 2315 is a composite number, we need to find its factors other than 1 and itself. We can do this by checking all the numbers from 2 to the square root of 2315 (approximately 48). If any of these numbers divide 2315 without leaving a remainder, then 2315 is a composite number. 

Let's start checking the numbers:
2 does not divide 2315, so it is not a factor.
3 does not divide 2315.
4 does not divide 2315.
5 divides 2315, as 2315 divided by 5 is 463 with no remainder. Therefore, 2315 is a composite number.

So, yes, 2315 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself (for example, 5 and 463).

No, 1839 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3 and 613.
###
To determine whether 1839 is a prime number, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we check if 1839 is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is not a prime number because prime numbers are only divisible by 1 and themselves.

2. If 1839 is not divisible by 2, we continue to check for divisibility by odd numbers up to the square root of 1839. This is because if any factor greater than the square root exists, the corresponding smaller factor would have already been found.

Checking divisibility by odd numbers: 

Dividing 1839 by 3, we get a quotient of 613 with no remainder.

Therefore, 1839 is divisible by 3, which means it is not a prime number.

So, 1839 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 1839 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 1839 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

No, 4274 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 2 and 2137.
###
To determine if 4274 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check if it is divisible by 2: 
4274 is not divisible by 2 because the last digit is not even (4 is not divisible by 2).

Step 2: Check if it is divisible by 3: 
The sum of the digits of 4274 is 4 + 2 + 7 + 4 = 17. Since 17 is not divisible by 3, 4274 is not divisible by 3.

Step 3: Check if it is divisible by 5: 
The last digit of 4274 is 4, which is not 0 or 5. Hence, 4274 is not divisible by 5.

Step 4: Check if it is divisible by 7: 
Let's apply the divisibility rule for 7. Removing the last digit (4), we get 427. Doubling the removed digit and subtracting it from the remaining number gives us 42 - (2*4) = 42 - 8 = 34. Since 34 is not divisible by 7, 4274 is not divisible by 7 either.

Step 5: Check if it is divisible by 11: 
The alternating sum of the digits of 4274 (4 - 2 + 7 - 4) is 5. Since 5 is not divisible by 11, 4274 is not divisible by 11.

Based on these steps, we can conclude that 4274 is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 4274 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 4274 is a composite number. A composite number is defined as any positive integer greater than 1 that can be evenly divided by at least one integer other than 1 and itself. In the case of 4274, it can be divided by 2, resulting in 2137. Therefore, 4274 is composite.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if 4274 is divisible by 2. If the last digit of the number is even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), then the entire number is divisible by 2. In this case, the last digit of 4274 is 4, so it is divisible by 2.

Next, we divide 4274 by 2: 4274 ÷ 2 = 2137. Since the division does not result in a whole number, 4274 is not divisible by 2.

Now, we can check if 4274 is divisible by any other numbers greater than 2 and less than its square root, which is approximately 65.4.

We can start with 3. We divide 4274 by 3: 4274 ÷ 3 ≈ 1424.6. Since the division does not result in a whole number, 4274 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue to check other numbers, such as 5, 7, 11, and so on. However, for the sake of simplicity, we can stop here and conclude that 4274 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 4274 is a prime number, not a composite number.

First, we find the square root of 5305, which is approximately 72.82. 

Next, we check if 5305 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Then, we check divisibility by prime numbers 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on, up to 73 (since it is the highest prime number less than the square root of 5305).

By checking, we find that 5305 is divisible by 5 (5305 ÷ 5 = 1061). 

Hence, 5305 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 5.
###
Yes, 5305 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 5305 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

1. First, we can check if 5305 is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is composite, since it has a factor other than 1 and itself. However, 5305 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we can check if 5305 is divisible by any odd numbers up to its square root, which is approximately 72.8. Starting with 3, we can try dividing 5305 by each odd number:

   3: 5305 ÷ 3 = 1768.333... (not divisible)
   5: 5305 ÷ 5 = 1061 (not divisible)
   7: 5305 ÷ 7 = 757.857... (not divisible)

   - We can calculate the square root of 7971 as approximately 89.30.

2. Check for divisibility by prime numbers up to 89.
   - Starting with the smallest prime number, 2, we divide 7971 by 2. The result is 3985.5, which is not a whole number.

3. Now, continue checking divisibility by prime numbers up to 89, incrementing one by one.
   - When we divide 7971 by 3, the result is 2657. That is not a whole number.
   - Similarly, dividing 7971 by 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, and 89 does not yield a whole number.

4. As we have checked for divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 7971, and no factors/whole number divisors are found, we can conclude that 7971 is a prime number.

Therefore, yes, 7971 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 7971 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do that, let's try dividing 7971 by numbers starting from 2 and going up to the square root of 7971 (rounded up to the nearest whole number). 

The square root of 7971 is approximately 89.3, so we will check divisibility by numbers up to 90.

Starting with 2, we find that 7971 divided by 2 is not a whole number. 

Next, we try 3. 7971 divided by 3 is also not a whole number. 

We continue this process, trying numbers 4, 5, 6, and so on up to 90. 

However, no number divides 7971 evenly without leaving a remainder. 

Since we haven't found any factors other than 1 and 7971 itself, the number 7971 is not divisible by any other number, making it a prime number. 

Therefore, 7971 is not a composite number.

Step 10: We have checked all the numbers up to the square root of 4226 and did not find any other factors. Therefore, we can conclude that 4226 is a prime number.

Answer: Yes, 4226 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 4226 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to check if it has divisors other than 1 and itself.

To begin, let's find the square root of 4226. It is approximately 64.988.

Now, we can check if any numbers between 2 and 64 divide evenly into 4226.

Upon checking, we find that 2 is a divisor of 4226 since 4226 divided by 2 equals 2113.

Therefore, 4226 is a composite number because it has divisors other than 1 and itself; specifically, it is divisible by both 2 and 2113.
###
Yes, 4226 is divisible by 2
###
No.
###
No, 1043 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 1043 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root. The square root of 1043 is approximately 32.28.

Checking for divisibility by prime numbers up to 32:

1. 1043 is not divisible by 2 because it is an odd number.
2. 1043 is not divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits (1 + 0 + 4 + 3) is not divisible by 3.
3. 1043 is not divisible by 5 because it does not end in 0 or 5.
4. 1043 is not divisible by 7 because there is no simple divisibility rule for 7.
5. 1043 is not divisible by 11 because it alternates positive and negative digit sums (1 - 0 + 4 - 3), which is not divisible by 11.
6. 1043 is not divisible by 13 because we would need to do division to check for this, and it is not divisible without a remainder.

Since we have checked up to prime number 13, and none of them divided 1043 evenly, we can conclude that 1043 is a prime number.

Therefore, 1043 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 1043 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 1043 is a composite number, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can try dividing 1043 by prime numbers starting from 2. If any of the divisions produce a whole number, then 1043 is a composite number. If all the divisions produce remainders, then 1043 is a prime number.

Let's start dividing 1043 by 2: 
1043 ÷ 2 = 521 remainder 1

The division did not produce a whole number, so let's try the next prime number, 3: 
1043 ÷ 3 = 347 remainder 2

Again, the division did not produce a whole number. Let's continue with 4: 
1043 ÷ 4 = 260 remainder 3

The division still did not produce a whole number. Let's try 5: 
1043 ÷ 5 = 208 remainder 3

We still haven't found a whole number division. Let's carry on with 6: 
1043 ÷ 6 = 173 remainder 5

The division did not produce a whole number. Let's try 7: 
1043 ÷ 7 = 149 remainder 6

Again, the division did not produce a whole number. Let's continue with 8: 
1043 ÷ 8 = 130 remainder 3

The division still did not produce a whole number. Let's try 9: 
1043 ÷ 9 = 115 remainder 8

The division did not produce a whole number. Let's move on to 10: 
1043 ÷ 10 = 104 remainder 3

Again, the division did not produce a whole number. 

As we can see, none of the divisions produced a whole number factor of 1043. Therefore, 1043 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

So, 1043 is a prime number, not a composite number.

No, 1981 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 3 and 661.
###
To determine if 1981 is a prime number, we can check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

First, we can observe that 1981 is an odd number since it does not end in a 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. This means it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any odd numbers up to the square root of 1981, which is approximately 44.5. We start with 3 and continue checking odd numbers.

1981 ÷ 3 = 660.333... (not divisible)
1981 ÷ 5 = 396.2 (not divisible)
1981 ÷ 7 = 283 (not divisible)
1981 ÷ 9 = 220.111... (not divisible)
1981 ÷ 11 = 180.090... (not divisible)
1981 ÷ 13 = 152.384... (not divisible)
1981 ÷ 15 = 132.066... (not divisible)
1981 ÷ 17 = 116.529... (not divisible)
1981 ÷ 19 = 104.263... (not divisible)
1981 ÷ 21 = 94.333... (not divisible)
1981 ÷ 23 = 86.130... (not divisible)
1981 ÷ 25 = 79.24 (not divisible)
1981 ÷ 27 = 73.370... (not divisible)
1981 ÷ 29 = 68.655... (not divisible)
1981 ÷ 31 = 63.903... (not divisible)
1981 ÷ 33 = 60.030... (not divisible)
1981 ÷ 35 = 56.6 (not divisible)
1981 ÷ 37 = 53.5 (not divisible)
1981 ÷ 39 = 50.769... (not divisible)
1981 ÷ 41 = 48.560... (not divisible)
1981 ÷ 43 = 46.116... (not divisible)
1981 ÷ 44 = 45.022... (not divisible)

As we can see, none of the numbers divide 1981 exactly. Therefore, 1981 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 1981 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 1981 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

One way to do this is to find all the numbers that divide 1981 evenly and check if any of them are not 1 or 1981. 

Starting with 2, we can divide 1981 by 2. However, 1981 is not evenly divisible by 2 since 1981 ÷ 2 = 990.5 which is not a whole number. 

Next, we can try dividing by 3. However, again, 1981 is not evenly divisible by 3 since 1981 ÷ 3 = 660.33 which is not a whole number. 

We can continue trying larger prime numbers as divisors, such as 5, 7, 11, etc., but we would find that none of them divide 1981 evenly. 

Since we cannot find any factors of 1981 other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that 1981 is a prime number and not composite.
###
Yes.
###
No.
###
No, 1389 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3 and 463.
###
To determine if 1389 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If a number is divisible by 2, then it is not a prime number. 

1389 is not an even number, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. If the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 3, then the number itself is divisible by 3. 

1 + 3 + 8 + 9 = 21

Since 21 is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 1389 is divisible by 3.

Thus, 1389 is not a prime number as it has factors other than 1 and itself (3 and 463).
###
Yes, 1389 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 1389 is a composite number, we need to factorize it and check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To begin, let's try dividing 1389 by smaller prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, etc. 

Attempting division by 2, we find that 1389 is not divisible by 2 since it is an odd number. 

Next, we try dividing by 3. The sum of the digits in 1389 (1 + 3 + 8 + 9) is 21, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 1389 is divisible by 3. 

So, we can write 1389 as 3 * 463. 

From this factorization, we can see that 1389 has factors other than 1 and itself (3 and 463), making it a composite number.
###

###
No, 4762 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2 and 2381.
###
To determine if 4762 is a prime number, we can use a trial division method. We will check if 4762 is divisible by any number from 2 up to the square root of 4762. 

First, we find the square root of 4762:
√4762 ≈ 68.988

Now, we will check divisibility by numbers from 2 up to 69:

4762 ÷ 2 = 2381 (not divisible)
4762 ÷ 3 = 1587.33 (not divisible)
4762 ÷ 4 = 1190.5 (not divisible)
.
.
.
4762 ÷ 67 = 71.194 (not divisible)
4762 ÷ 68 = 70.029 (not divisible)

We have checked divisibility by all numbers from 2 up to the square root of 4762, and we did not find any divisor. Therefore, 4762 is a prime number.

So, yes, 4762 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 4762 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 4762 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

Step 1: Find the square root of 4762. The square root of 4762 is approximately 68.992.

Step 2: Check if there are any factors of 4762 from 2 to 68.992. 

When we check the factors of 4762, we find that it has factors such as 2, 7, 11, 67, 77, and 154.

Since 4762 has factors other than 1 and itself, it is a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes.
###
No, 3646 is not a prime number. It can be evenly divided by 2, 7, 13, and 139.
###
To determine if 3646 is a prime number, we will check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 
First, we check if it's divisible by 2. Since 3646 ends with an even number (6), it is divisible by 2.
3646 ÷ 2 = 1823

Hence, 3646 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2.
###
Yes, 3646 is a composite number because it can be divided by numbers other than 1 and itself.
###
To determine whether 3646 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can see that it is an even number since the last digit is 6. Therefore, we know that 2 is a factor of 3646. 

To further check for factors, we can find the square root of 3646. The square root of 3646 is approximately 60.38. We only need to check for factors up to 60 since any factor larger than the square root would pair with a factor smaller than the square root to give a product greater than 3646. 

By checking for divisibility by numbers from 3 to 60, we find that 2 and 29 are factors of 3646. 

Since 3646 has factors other than 1 and itself (2 and 29), it is a composite number.
###
Yes, 3646 is divisible by 2.
###
Yes
###
No, 7179 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 7179 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any other numbers besides 1 and itself.

First, let's check if it is divisible by 2. 

7179 ÷ 2 = 3589.5

Since the result is not an integer, 7179 is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check if it is divisible by 3.

7 + 1 + 7 + 9 = 24

24 ÷ 3 = 8

Since the result is an integer, 7179 is divisible by 3.

Therefore, 7179 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 3.
###
Yes, 7179 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 7179 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by finding the prime factorization of 7179. 

7179 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2. 

To check if it is divisible by 3, we add its digits: 7 + 1 + 7 + 9 = 24. Since 24 is divisible by 3, 7179 is also divisible by 3.

Dividing 7179 by 3 gives us 2393. 

Next, we can check if 2393 has any factors. 

We can try dividing it by prime numbers up to the square root of 2393, which is approximately 48.9. 

By trying out prime numbers, we find that 2393 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, or 43. 

Thus, we conclude that 7179 is a composite number because it is divisible by 3 and has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 7179 is divisible by 3.
###
Yes
###
No, 2818 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 2, 7, 13, 14, 26, 49, 91, 98, 182, 343, 637, and 1274.
###
To determine if 2818 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

First, we need to find the square root of 2818, which is approximately 53.081. 

Next, we can try dividing 2818 by the primes starting from 2 up until 53.

2818 divided by 2 gives a quotient of 1409 and a remainder of 0. Therefore, 2818 is divisible by 2 and is not a prime number.

Since 2818 is divisible by 2, we can conclude that it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 2818 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 2818 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. We can start by finding the factors of 2818 by trial and error or using a method such as finding prime factors.

2818 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2. Dividing 2818 by 2 gives us 1409. 

To check if 1409 is divisible by any prime numbers, we can try dividing it by prime numbers starting from 2 and going up to the square root of 1409, which is approximately 37.

By checking prime numbers, we find that 1409 is not divisible evenly by any primes up to 37. 

Now, since we have exhausted all possible factors, we can conclude that 2818 is a prime number. 

Therefore, 2818 is not a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes
###
No, 7113 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 7113 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if 2 is a divisor of 7113. Since 7113 is an odd number (not divisible evenly by 2), we can eliminate 2 as a factor.

Next, we can check if 3 is a factor of 7113. By adding the digits of 7113 (7 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12), we see that 7113 is divisible by 3.

Thus, 7113 is not a prime number since it is divisible by 3.
###
Yes, 7113 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 7113 is a composite number, let's first find its factors.

We can start by checking for divisibility by smaller prime numbers:
- It is not divisible by 2 because the last digit is odd (not divisible by 2).
- It is not divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits (7 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12) is not divisible by 3.

Now, we can continue by dividing it by prime numbers greater than 3:
- It is not divisible by 5 because the last digit is not 0 or 5.
- It is not divisible by 7 because the sum of its digits (7 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12) is not divisible by 7.

Since it is not divisible by any of these smaller prime numbers, we can conclude that 7113 is a prime number.

So, 7113 is not a composite number; it is a prime number.

###
No, 4045 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 5 and 809.
###
To determine if 4045 is a prime number, we can use the process of trial division. 

First, we check if 4045 is divisible by 2, which is the smallest prime number. If 4045 is divisible by 2, then it is not a prime number.

4045 ÷ 2 = 2022 R 1

Since it is not divisible by 2 evenly, we continue to check if it is divisible by other prime numbers greater than 2. The next prime number is 3. 

4045 ÷ 3 = 1348 R 1

Since it is not divisible by 3 evenly either, we continue checking. The next prime number is 5. 

4045 ÷ 5 = 809 R 0

4045 is divisible by 5. Therefore, it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 4045 is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has at least one factor other than 1 and itself. In the case of 4045, it can be factored into 5 * 809, where both 5 and 809 are factors of 4045 other than 1 and 4045 itself.
###
To determine if 4045 is a composite number, we need to consider its factors.

The factors of 4045 can be found by dividing it by different numbers and checking if the division is precise (without any remainder). If there are factors other than 1 and the number itself, then it is a composite number.

Let's start dividing 4045 by different numbers:
4045 ÷ 1 = 4045
4045 ÷ 2 = 2022.5 (not precise)
4045 ÷ 3 = 1348.3333 (not precise)
4045 ÷ 4 = 1011.25 (not precise)
4045 ÷ 5 = 809 (not precise)
4045 ÷ 6 = 674.1667 (not precise)

Since we haven't found any factors other than 1 and 4045, we can conclude that 4045 is a prime number, not a composite number.
###
No.
###
Yes.
###
No, 7763 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 7 and 1109.
###
To determine whether 7763 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any integer greater than 1 and less than its square root.

First, let's check if it is divisible by 2. 7763 is not an even number, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check if it is divisible by any odd numbers greater than 2. We can start by dividing it by 3. Upon calculating, we find that 7763 ÷ 3 = 2587.6667. Since the result is not an integer, 7763 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue checking divisibility by odd numbers up to the square root of 7763, which is approximately 88.1504. However, we can observe that 7763 does not have any obvious factors, and it would be very time-consuming to manually check all odd numbers up to 88.1504 to confirm its primality.

Therefore, we could conclude that 7763 is most likely a prime number. However, to definitively prove its primality, we would need to use more advanced techniques like the Sieve of Eratosthenes or perform extensive calculations.
###
Yes, 7763 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if 7763 is divisible by any number from 2 to its square root, which is approximately 88.14. 

If there is any number between 2 and 88.14 that divides evenly into 7763, then 7763 is a composite number. Otherwise, it is a prime number. 

After performing the calculations, we find that 7763 is not divisible by any number between 2 and 88.14. 

Thus, we can conclude that 7763 is a prime number and not a composite number.
###

###
Yes, 5997 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 3.
###
To determine if 5997 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any numbers less than its square root (i.e., up to approximately 77.4).

We start dividing 5997 by prime numbers starting from 2 and check if any of them evenly divide it. If we find any divisor, then it is not a prime number.

Let's check if it is divisible by 2:
5997 ÷ 2 = 2998.5 - Not divisible

Next, we check if it is divisible by 3:
5997 ÷ 3 = 1999 - Not divisible

Continuing this process, we check if it is divisible by 5:
5997 ÷ 5 = 1199.4 - Not divisible

Then we check if it is divisible by 7:
5997 ÷ 7 = 856.7 - Not divisible

Next, we check if it is divisible by 11:
5997 ÷ 11 = 545.18 - Not divisible

Proceeding this way, we check if it is divisible by 13:
5997 ÷ 13 = 461.31 - Not divisible

Continuing, we check if it is divisible by 17:
5997 ÷ 17 = 352.76 - Not divisible

Lastly, we check if it is divisible by 19:
5997 ÷ 19 = 315.63 - Not divisible

Since we have checked all prime numbers up to the square root of 5997 and have not found any divisors, we can conclude that 5997 is a prime number.
###
No, 5997 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
###
To determine whether a number is composite or not, we need to find its factors, other than 1 and itself. 

To begin, we can check if 2 is a factor of 5997. If it is, then 5997 would be a composite number. However, since 5997 is an odd number and not divisible by 2, we can eliminate it as a factor.

Next, we can check if 3 is a factor of 5997. To do this, we add up the individual digits of 5997 and check if the sum is divisible by 3. In this case, 5 + 9 + 9 + 7 = 30, and 30 is divisible by 3. Therefore, 3 is a factor of 5997 and it is a composite number.

Hence, 5997 is a composite number.

###
Yes.
###
No, 6065 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 6065 is a prime number, we can divide it by prime numbers starting with 2 and moving up to the square root of 6065. If any division results in a whole number, then 6065 is not a prime number.

Using this method, let's check:

Step 1: Find the square root of 4827. The square root of 4827 is approximately 69.49.

Step 2: Check if 4827 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 4827.

Starting with the smallest prime number, which is 2, we see that 4827 is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we check if 4827 is divisible by 3. Adding the individual digits of 4827, we get 4 + 8 + 2 + 7 = 21. 21 is not divisible by 3, so 4827 is also not divisible by 3.

Moving on to the next prime number, which is 5, 4827 is not divisible by 5.

Continuing this process, we find that 4827 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to its square root.

Step 3: Since 4827 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to its square root, we can conclude that 4827 is a prime number.

Therefore, 4827 is indeed a prime number.
###

To determine if 7431 is a prime number, we can follow a step-by-step approach:

1. Check for divisibility by primes up to the square root of 7431 (approximately 86). 

2. Start dividing 7431 by primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47… and so on, up to 86.

3. If any of these primes divide evenly into 7431, then it is not a prime number.

7431 is not divisible by 7 (no neat division, the remainder is 1).

7431 is not divisible by 11 (no neat division, the alternating digit sum, i.e., (7 - 4 + 3 - 1), is not a multiple of 11).

Similarly, by checking with primes up to the square root of 7431, we find that it is not divisible by any of them.

Therefore, we can conclude that 7431 is a prime number, as it does not have any divisors other than 1 and itself.
###

###
To determine if 7586 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any prime number less than its square root. 

The square root of 7586 is approximately 87.09. 
Now we can check for divisors up to 87. 

We start with the prime number 2. Dividing 7586 by 2, we get 3793, which is not a whole number, so 2 is not a divisor. 

We then move on to 3. Dividing 7586 by 3, we get 2528.67, which is also not a whole number, so 3 is not a divisor. 

Continuing this process, we find that 7586 is not divisible by any prime number less than 87. 

Therefore, we can conclude that 7586 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 7586 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether 7586 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, let's find the divisors of 7586. We start by dividing 7586 by 2:

7586 ÷ 2 = 3793

Next, we divide 7586 by 3:

7586 ÷ 3 = 2528.6667

7586 is not divisible evenly by 3.

We'll continue dividing by subsequent numbers to see if 7586 has any more factors. However, we notice that 3793, obtained when dividing by 2, is a prime number. Since it is a prime number, we can conclude that 7586 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

###
To determine if 2219 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, let's check if it is divisible by 2. 2219 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check if it is divisible by 3. We can add up the digits of 2219: 2 + 2 + 1 + 9 = 14. Since 14 is not divisible by 3, 2219 is also not divisible by 3.

Now, let's check if it is divisible by any numbers up to the square root of 2219, which is approximately 47. Therefore, we need to check if 2219 is divisible by any primes less than 47.

Checking for divisibility by primes less than 47, we find that 2219 is not divisible by any of them.

Therefore, we can conclude that 2219 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 2219 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether 2219 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

One way to do this is to divide 2219 by numbers starting from 2 up to the square root of 2219 (rounded up to the nearest whole number). 

The square root of 2219 is approximately 47.1, so we will check numbers up to 48. 

Let's start dividing 2219 by 2:
2219 ÷ 2 = 1109.5 (not an integer)

Next, let's try dividing by 3:
2219 ÷ 3 = 739.6667 (not an integer)

We can continue dividing by successive integers up to 48, and if we do not find any factors other than 1 and 2219, then 2219 is a prime number. 

In this case, we can conclude that 2219 is a prime number since we did not find any factors other than 1 and 2219 in the range of 2 to 48.
###

No, 1198 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2 and 599.
###
To check if 1198 is a prime number, we need to determine if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if 2 is a factor of 1198. If 1198 is divisible by 2, then it is not a prime number. 

1198 ÷ 2 = 599, which is not an integer. 

Since 1198 is not divisible by 2, we can move on to the next possible factor, which is 3. 

1198 ÷ 3 = 399.33, which is not an integer. 

Continuing this process with the remaining prime numbers, we find that 1198 is not divisible by any of them. 

Therefore, we can conclude that 1198 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 1198 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 1198 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

1198 divided by 2 equals 599.

Since 599 is a prime number, we cannot divide it further. 

So, the prime factors of 1198 are 2 and 599. 

Since 1198 has more than two factors (1, 2, 599, and 1198), it is a composite number.
###

###
No, 7142 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2 and 3571.
###
To determine if 7142 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, check if 7142 is divisible by 2. Since 7142 is an even number (ends in 2), it is divisible by 2. Hence, it is not a prime number.

Therefore, 7142 is not a prime number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
7142 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 7142 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. One way to do this is by finding the prime factorization of 7142.

To find the prime factorization, we start by dividing 7142 by the smallest prime number, which is 2:

7142 ÷ 2 = 3571

Since 3571 is not divisible by 2, we move on to the next prime number, which is 3:

3571 ÷ 3 = 1190 remainder 1

Again, 1190 is not divisible by 3, so we move on to the next prime number, which is 5:

1190 ÷ 5 = 238

238 is divisible by 5:

238 ÷ 5 = 47

47 is a prime number itself.

So, the prime factorization of 7142 is 2 × 3 × 5 × 47.

Since 7142 has factors other than 1 and itself, specifically 2, 3, 5, and 47, it is a composite number.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since the number ends in 5, it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we could check for divisibility by 3. By adding up the digits of 7465 (7+4+6+5 = 22), we see that 7465 is not divisible by 3 because the sum is not divisible by 3. 

Now we can check if it is divisible by 5. As mentioned earlier, it ends in 5, so it is not divisible by 5. 

Moving on, we can check if it is divisible by any numbers up to the square root of 7465. The square root of 7465 is approximately 86.407, so we only need to check for prime factors up to 86.

By checking divisor candidates such as 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, etc., we find that none of these divide evenly into 7465. 

Therefore, since we did not find any factors other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that 7465 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 7465 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 7465 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any odd numbers up to its square root. The square root of 7465 is approximately 86.36. 

We can start dividing 7465 by 3. 

7465 ÷ 3 = 2488 R 1

Since there is a remainder of 1, 7465 is not divisible by 3.

Similarly, we can continue checking divisibility by odd numbers up to 86. 

By following this process, we will find that 7465 is not divisible by 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on, up to 86.

21. 7438 ÷ 73 = 101.93 (not divisible)
22. 7438 ÷ 79 = 94.18 (not divisible)
23. 7438 ÷ 83 = 89.69 (not divisible)

None of the prime numbers up to 83 divide 7438 evenly. Therefore, we can conclude that 7438 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 7438 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 7438 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

First, we check if 7438 is divisible by 2. If the last digit is divisible by 2 (even), then the number is divisible by 2. Checking the last digit of 7438, we see that it is not even (8 is not divisible by 2). Thus, 7438 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check if 7438 is divisible by 3. The sum of all the digits of 7438 is 7+4+3+8=22. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, 7438 is not divisible by 3.

Then, we check if 7438 is divisible by 5. The last digit of 7438 (8) is not 0 or 5, so 7438 is not divisible by 5.

We can continue this process for other primes such as 7, 11, 13, etc. However, given that 7438 is a relatively large number, we can stop here and conclude that 7438 does not have any divisors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 7438 is a prime number.

No, 1527 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3 and 509.
###
To determine if 1527 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Find the square root of 1527:
√1527 ≈ 39.1

Step 2: Check divisibility by numbers up to the square root:
1527 ÷ 2 = 763.5 (not divisible)
1527 ÷ 3 = 509 (not divisible)
1527 ÷ 4 = 381.75 (not divisible)
1527 ÷ 5 = 305.4 (not divisible)
…
1527 ÷ 38 ≈ 40.18 (not divisible)

Since we have checked all the numbers up to approximately the square root of 1527, and it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 1527 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 1527 is a composite number.
###
Yes, let's think step by step to determine whether 1527 is a composite number.

First, we need to understand that a composite number is a positive integer that has at least one factor other than 1 and itself. In other words, a composite number can be divided evenly by at least one number other than 1 and the number itself.

To determine if 1527 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and 1527. We can do this by checking all the numbers from 2 to the square root of 1527 (rounded up to the nearest whole number).

The square root of 1527 is approximately 39.12, so we can check all numbers from 2 to 40 to see if any of them divide evenly into 1527.

When we divide 1527 by 2, we get a quotient of 763.5, which is not a whole number. Similarly, when we divide 1527 by 3, we get a quotient of 509, which is also not a whole number. We can continue checking all the numbers up to 40, but since we have already checked the prime numbers up to 3 and the number is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 1527 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 1527 is not a composite number.
###

###
Yes.
###
Yes, 3983 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 3983 is a prime number, we can follow a step by step process:

1. First, we check if 3983 is divisible by 2. Since 3983 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we continue to the next step.

2. Next, we check if 3983 is divisible by any prime numbers up to the square root of 3983. The square root of 3983 is approximately 63.11. We need to check divisibility by prime numbers up to 63.

3. Starting with the smallest prime number, 3, we divide 3983 by 3. Performing the division, we get a quotient of 1327 with a remainder of 2. Since the remainder is not zero, we continue to the next prime number.

4. We move on to the next prime number, 5, and divide 3983 by 5. This division gives a quotient of 796 with a remainder of 3. Again, the remainder is not zero, so we proceed to the next prime number.

5. The next prime number is 7. Dividing 3983 by 7 gives a quotient of 569 with a remainder of 0. Since the remainder is zero, we can conclude that 3983 is divisible by 7.

Therefore, 3983 is not a prime number since it is divisible by 7.
###
Yes, 3983 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 3983 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can find the square root of 3983, which is approximately 63.13. We only need to check for factors up to this point.

Now, we need to check if any numbers between 2 and 63 divide evenly into 3983. Starting from 2, we find that 3983 is not divisible by 2. Similarly, we check for divisibility by 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, etc. 

Upon checking, we find that 3983 is not divisible by any of these numbers. This means that it does not have any other factors besides 1 and itself.

Therefore, 3983 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
###
Yes.
###
No, 3983 is not divisible by 569.
###
No, 3046 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 2, 7, 13, and 47.
###
To determine if 3046 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, let's check if it is divisible by 2. Since 3046 is an even number (the last digit is 6), it is divisible by 2.

Dividing 3046 by 2, we get 1523 with no remainder.

Therefore, 3046 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 2.
###
Yes, 3046 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, let's find the divisors of 3046 by testing numbers up to its square root (approximately 55). 

We start by checking if 3046 is divisible by 2. Dividing 3046 by 2 gives us a quotient of 1523 with a remainder of 0. 

Therefore, 2 is a divisor of 3046. 

Next, we need to check whether there are any other divisors between 2 and the square root of 3046. 

Since we have already found one divisor (2), we only need to test odd numbers greater than 2. 

Testing odd numbers starting from 3, we find that 3046 is not divisible by any of them. 

Therefore, the only divisors of 3046 are 1, 2, and 3046 (itself). 

Since 3046 has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is a composite number.
###
Yes, 3046 is divisible by 2.
###
Yes
###
No, 1894 is not a prime number. It can be divided by 2, 13, 73, and 146.
###
To determine whether 1894 is a prime number, we can check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we want to check if 2 is a factor of 1894. If 1894 is divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder, then it is not a prime number. 

1894 ÷ 2 = 947

Since 1894 is not divisible by 2, we move on to check if 3 is a factor.

To check if 3 is a factor of 1894, we add the individual digits of 1894 together and see if the resulting sum is divisible by 3.

1 + 8 + 9 + 4 = 22

Since 22 is not divisible by 3, we conclude that 3 is not a factor of 1894.

We can continue checking for factors by dividing 1894 by successive prime numbers, but this process can be time-consuming.

Alternatively, we can use a more efficient method. The square root of 1894 is approximately 43.5 (rounded to the nearest whole number). We only need to check for factors up to 43.

By checking for factors up to 43, we find that 1894 is divisible evenly by 2, 947, and 1894.

Therefore, 1894 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 1894 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 1894 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. 

Step 1: We can start by checking divisibility by 2. If 1894 is divisible by 2, then it is not a prime number and therefore not a composite number. 1894 divided by 2 is 947, which is not a whole number. So, 1894 is not divisible by 2.

Step 2: Next, we can check if 1894 is divisible by any odd numbers greater than 3. We don't need to check numbers less than 3, as they are already covered by step 1. Checking all odd numbers greater than 3 would be time-consuming, so we can use a faster approach by checking divisibility up to the square root of 1894. 

The square root of 1894 is approximately 43.48, so we only need to check divisibility by odd numbers less than or equal to 43.

Step 3: Checking divisibility by odd numbers less than or equal to 43:

- 1894 divided by 3 gives a quotient of 631.33, not a whole number.
- 1894 divided by 5 gives a quotient of 378.8, not a whole number.
- 1894 divided by 7 gives a quotient of 270.57, not a whole number.
- 1894 divided by 11 gives a quotient of 172.18, not a whole number.
- 1894 divided by 13 gives a quotient of 145.69, not a whole number.
- 1894 divided by 17 gives a quotient of 111.41, not a whole number.
- 1894 divided by 19 gives a quotient of 99.68, not a whole number.
- 1894 divided by 23 gives a quotient of 82.35, not a whole number.
- 1894 divided by 29 gives a quotient of 65.31, not a whole number.
- 1894 divided by 31 gives a quotient of 61.16, not a whole number.
- 1894 divided by 37 gives a quotient of 51.24, not a whole number.
- 1894 divided by 41 gives a quotient of 46.20, not a whole number.
- 1894 divided by 43 gives a quotient of 44.02, not a whole number.

Step 4: Since none of the divisors up to the square root of 1894 result in a whole number quotient, we can conclude that 1894 is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 1894 is a prime number and not a composite number.

Yes
###
No, 2605 is not a prime number.
###
To determine whether 2605 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

The square root of 2605 is approximately 51, so we only need to check divisibility by prime numbers up to 51.

Let's start with the smallest prime number, which is 2. 2605 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check divisibility by the next prime number, which is 3. If we add up the digits of 2605 (2 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 13), we see that the sum is not divisible by 3. Hence, 2605 is not divisible by 3.

We continue this process until we reach the next prime number, 5. Once again, the sum of the digits of 2605 (2 + 6 + 0 + 5) is not divisible by 5, so 2605 is not divisible by 5.

Proceeding to the next prime number, 7, the sum of the digits of 2605 is 13, which is not divisible by 7.

Continuing this process, we find that 2605 is not divisible by 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.

Therefore, we can conclude that 2605 is a prime number since it is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.
###
Yes, 2605 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 2605 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

We can start by finding the prime factors of 2605.

The prime factorization of 2605 is:
2605 = 5 × 521

Since 2605 can be expressed as the product of two numbers other than 1 and itself (5 and 521), it is a composite number.

The square root of 3662 is approximately 60.54. We can check if 3662 is divisible by prime numbers up to 60.

Let's check if it is divisible by 2:
3662 ÷ 2 = 1831

Since 3662 divided by 2 gives us a whole number, it is divisible by 2.

Therefore, 3662 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2.
###
Yes, 3662 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 3662 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can find the prime factorization of 3662.

The prime factorization of 3662 is 2 × 1831.

So, 3662 is a composite number since it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 3662 is divisible by 2.
###
Yes.
###
No, 2302 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it is divisible by any whole number other than 1 and itself. 

For 2302, we can start by finding its prime factorization. 

To do this, we will check divisibility with prime numbers starting from 2. 

2302 ÷ 2 = 1151

Since 1151 is a prime number, we have found the prime factorization of 2302.

So, 2302 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 2302 is a composite number.
###
Yes, let's think step by step to determine if 2302 is a composite number. 
First, we need to determine the factors of 2302. To do this, we can start by dividing 2302 by 2, since it is the smallest prime number. 

2302 ÷ 2 = 1151

Since 1151 is a prime number, we can conclude that 2302 is not divisible evenly by 2. 

Next, we can try dividing by 3, another prime number. 

2302 ÷ 3 = 767.33

Since 767.33 is not a whole number, we can conclude that 2302 is not divisible evenly by 3. 

We can continue this process and try dividing by other prime numbers such as 5, 7, 11, etc. 

However, since 2302 is not divisible evenly by 2 or 3, it is unlikely to be divisible by larger prime numbers. 

Therefore, based on our step-by-step approach, we can conclude that 2302 is a composite number.
###

###
No, 7377 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 7377 is a prime number, we can first check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

The square root of 7377 is approximately 85.9. Therefore, we only need to check divisibility by prime numbers up to 85.

Checking divisibility by primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83.

We find that 7377 is not divisible by any of these primes. Therefore, we can conclude that 7377 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 7377 is a composite number.
A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has at least one divisor other than 1 and itself. In the case of 7377, it is divisible by 3, 7, 11, and 151. Therefore, it is a composite number.
###
To determine if 7377 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can start by finding the prime factors of 7377. We can divide it by prime numbers starting from 2 and continuing upwards until we find a factor. 

7377 ÷ 2 = 3688.5
7377 ÷ 3 = 2459
7377 ÷ 5 = 1475.4
7377 ÷ 7 = 1053.9
7377 ÷ 11 = 670.6
7377 ÷ 13 = 567.5

We can see that 13 is a factor of 7377. Therefore, 7377 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes.
###
No.
###
No, 5169 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 5169 is a prime number, we can check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

First, let's check if it is divisible by 2. If the last digit of a number is even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), then the number itself is divisible by 2. However, 5169 ends with 9, which is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check if it is divisible by 3. For a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must also be divisible by 3. In this case, 5 + 1 + 6 + 9 = 21, which is not divisible by 3.

Since we have ruled out divisibility by 2 and 3, we can now check divisibility by other prime numbers up to the square root of the number. 

However, instead of manually checking all the divisors, we can use a shortcut. If a number is not divisible by 2 or 3, then it is often safe to assume that it is also not divisible by small primes like 5 or 7.

Therefore, based on the above analysis, we can conclude that 5169 is indeed a prime number.
###
Yes, 5169 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 5169 is a composite number, we need to check if it can be evenly divided by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check for divisibility by 2. Since 5169 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check for divisibility by 3. To check if a number is divisible by 3, we can add up its digits and check if the sum is divisible by 3. In this case, 5 + 1 + 6 + 9 = 21, which is divisible by 3, so 5169 is divisible by 3.

Therefore, 5169 can be evenly divided by 3 and is not a prime number. Therefore, 5169 is a composite number.

###
To determine if 8193 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number besides 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2.
8193 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.

Step 2: Check divisibility by 3.
8193 follows the divisibility rule for 3: the sum of its digits, 8 + 1 + 9 + 3, is 21, and 21 is divisible by 3. Therefore, 8193 is divisible by 3.

Since 8193 is divisible by 3, it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 8193 is a composite number. It can be expressed as the product of two factors other than 1 and itself, specifically: 3 * 2731 = 8193.
###
To determine if 8193 is a composite number, we need to check if it can be divided by any numbers other than 1 and itself without leaving a remainder. 

To do this, we can start by dividing 8193 by smaller prime numbers such as 2, 3, 5, and so on. 

8193 ÷ 2 = 4096.5 (not an integer)
8193 ÷ 3 = 2731 (not an integer)
8193 ÷ 5 = 1638.6 (not an integer)
8193 ÷ 7 = 1170.4 (not an integer)

At this point, we can see that 8193 is not divisible by any of these prime numbers, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it is a prime number either. 

To exhaust all possibilities, we can continue by dividing 8193 by prime numbers above 7 such as 11, 13, 17, and so on. 

8193 ÷ 11 = 744.8 (not an integer)
8193 ÷ 13 = 630.2 (not an integer)
8193 ÷ 17 = 481.9 (not an integer)

We can continue this process, but even one of these divisions resulting in an integer would prove that 8193 is not a prime number. 

Therefore, after checking various divisions, we can conclude that 8193 is indeed a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes
###
No, 7143 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3 and 2381.
###
To determine if 7143 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If the number is divisible by 2, it cannot be a prime number because it has another divisor other than 1 and itself.

However, 7143 is not divisible by 2 (since the last digit is odd), so we move on to the next prime number, which is 3.

To check if 7143 is divisible by 3, we add up the individual digits: 7 + 1 + 4 + 3 = 15. If 15 is divisible by 3, then 7143 is also divisible by 3.

In this case, 15 is divisible by 3 (15 ÷ 3 = 5), so 7143 is divisible by 3.

Therefore, 7143 is not a prime number because it has divisors other than 1 and itself (specifically, 3 and 2381).
###
No, 7143 is not a composite number.
###
To determine if 7143 is a composite number, we need to check if it can be divided evenly by any number other than 1 and itself.

Let's start by checking if it is divisible by 2:
7143 ÷ 2 = 3571.5

Since the result is not a whole number, 7143 is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check if it is divisible by 3:
7 + 1 + 4 + 3 = 15
15 ÷ 3 = 5

Since the sum of the digits is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 7143 is divisible by 3.

Therefore, 7143 is a composite number, as it can be divided evenly by 3 and other numbers as well.

The square root of 1967 is approximately 44.33.

Now, let's check if 1967 is divisible by any integers between 2 and 45.

Starting with 2, we find that 1967 ÷ 2 = 983.5, which is not an integer.

Moving on, we check with 3: 1967 ÷ 3 = 655.67, also not an integer.

Continuing this process, we find that 1967 is not divisible by any integer between 2 and 45.

Therefore, we can conclude that 1967 is a prime number, as it is only divisible by 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 1967 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 1967 is a composite number, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

We start by trying to divide 1967 by prime numbers. We know that if any of the prime numbers divide 1967 without a remainder, then 1967 is composite. 

The prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 1967 (which is approximately 44.35) are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, and 43.

We can now systematically check if any of these prime numbers divide 1967.

- 1967 ÷ 2 = 983.5 (not an integer)
- 1967 ÷ 3 = 655.67 (not an integer)
- 1967 ÷ 5 = 393.4 (not an integer)
- 1967 ÷ 7 = 281 (integer)
- 1967 ÷ 11 = 179.7 (not an integer)
- 1967 ÷ 13 = 151.31 (not an integer)
- 1967 ÷ 17 = 115.7 (not an integer)
- 1967 ÷ 19 = 103.53 (not an integer)
- 1967 ÷ 23 = 85.87 (not an integer)
- 1967 ÷ 29 = 67.83 (not an integer)
- 1967 ÷ 31 = 63.45 (not an integer)
- 1967 ÷ 37 = 53.16 (not an integer)
- 1967 ÷ 41 = 47.97 (not an integer)
- 1967 ÷ 43 = 45.74 (not an integer)

Since none of these prime numbers divide 1967 evenly, we can conclude that 1967 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 1967 is a prime number, not a composite number.

Yes, 2589 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 2589 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2 
Since the last digit of 2589 is 9, which is odd, we can conclude that 2589 is not divisible by 2. 

Step 2: Check divisibility by 3 
To check if a number is divisible by 3, we sum up its individual digits and check if the sum is divisible by 3. 
In this case, 2 + 5 + 8 + 9 = 24, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 2589 is not divisible by 3. 

Step 3: Check divisibility by other primes 
We would need to check for divisibility by other prime numbers like 5, 7, 11, etc. However, we are not able to conclude if 2589 is divisible by any of these primes without further calculations. 

Since we have not found any divisors of 2589 other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that 2589 is a prime number.
###

###
To determine if 2589 is a composite number or not, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can start by finding the square root of 2589. The square root of 2589 is approximately 50.8827.

Next, we can check if any numbers from 2 up to 50.8827 divide evenly into 2589. If we find any such numbers, then 2589 is a composite number.

Let's go through the numbers from 2 up to 50.8827:

Next, we can check if 3 is a divisor of 1351. To do this, we add up the digits of 1351 (1 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 10) and check if the sum is divisible by 3. Since 10 is not divisible by 3, 3 is not a factor of 1351.

We can continue this process and check if 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are divisors of 1351. However, since 1351 is not divisible by any of these numbers, we can conclude that none of them are factors of 1351.

Finally, we can check if 10 is a divisor of 1351. Since the last digit of 1351 is 1, it is not divisible by 10.

Thus, after checking all possible divisors, we can conclude that 1351 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 1351 is a prime number.
###

5613 ÷ 2 = 2806.5

Since the result is not an integer, we can proceed to divide by the next prime number, which is 3.

5613 ÷ 3 = 1871

Again, the result is not an integer, so we move on to the next prime number, which is 5.

5613 ÷ 5 = 1122.6

Still, the result is not an integer, so we continue dividing by the next prime number.

5613 ÷ 7 = 801.857...

The result is still not an integer, so we progress to the next prime number.

5613 ÷ 11 = 510.272...

Once again, the result is not an integer, so we keep dividing.

5613 ÷ 13 = 431.769...

The result is still not an integer, so we move on.

5613 ÷ 17 = 329.588...

The division does not result in an integer, so we proceed to the next prime number.

5613 ÷ 19 = 295.421...

To determine if 2258 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we check if it is divisible by 2. Since 2258 is an even number, it is divisible by 2. Therefore, it is not a prime number.

2258 can be factored as: 
2258 = 2 * 1129

So, 2258 is not a prime number because it has divisors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 2258 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can try dividing 2258 by numbers starting from 2 and going up to the square root of 2258. If we find any factors, then the number is composite.

√2258 ≈ 47.53

Let's start dividing 2258 by numbers:

2258 ÷ 2 = 1129
2258 ÷ 3 = 752.67
2258 ÷ 4 = 564.5
...
2258 ÷ 47 ≈ 48.08

###
To determine if 5803 is a prime number, we need to check whether it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. Since 5803 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can eliminate 2 as a factor.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any odd numbers up to the square root of 5803, which is approximately 76. Finally, we check for divisibility by these odd numbers: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, and 73.

Checking 5803 divided by these primes, we find that none of them are exact divisors of 5803. Therefore, we can conclude that 5803 is  prime number.
###

To determine if 7415 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any other number besides 1 and itself.

The first thing we can notice is that 7415 ends in 5, which means it is divisible by 5.

We can then divide 7415 by 5 to check for other possible factors.

7415 ÷ 5 = 1483

Since 1483 is a prime number, we can conclude that 7415 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 7415 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

Divisibility by 2: 7415 is not even, so it is not divisible by 2.

Divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of 7415 is 7 + 4 + 1 + 5 = 17, which is not divisible by 3. Hence, 7415 is not divisible by 3.

Divisibility by 5: The last digit of 7415 is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Divisibility by 7: To check this, we can use the divisibility by 7 rule. Doubling the last digit (5) and subtracting it from the remaining truncated number 741 gives us 741 - 10 = 731. We repeat the process for 731: 73 - 2(1) = 73 - 2 = 71, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 7415 is not divisible by 7.

Divisibility by 11: We can also use the divisibility by 11 rule here. The alternating sum of the digits of 7415 is 7 - 4 + 1 - 5 = -1, which is not divisible by 11. Thus, 7415 is not divisible by 11.

Since 7415 is not divisible by any of the primes tested (2, 3, 5, 7, or 11), we can conclude that 7415 is a prime number.

Therefore, 7415 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 7415 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself. Its prime factorization is 5 x 1483.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, let's find the factors of 7415. We can start by dividing it by 2:

7415 ÷ 2 = 3707 remainder 1

Since 2 did not divide evenly into 7415, let's try dividing by 3:

7415 ÷ 3 = 2471 remainder 2

Next, we can try dividing by 4, but since the last digit is odd, we know it is not divisible by 4. 

Continuing to divide, we find:

7415 ÷ 5 = 1483 remainder 0

7415 ÷ 6 = 1235 remainder 5

7415 ÷ 7 = 1059 remainder 2

7415 ÷ 8 = 926 remainder 7

7415 ÷ 9 = 823 remainder 2

7415 ÷ 10 = 741 remainder 5

We can see that 7415 is not divisible by any numbers between 2 and 10, so we conclude that it is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 7415 is a prime number, not a composite number.

Step 1: Take the square root of 5578. The square root of 5578 is approximately 74.712.

Step 2: Check for divisibility with prime numbers less than or equal to 74.

- 5578 is not divisible by 2 because it ends in an even number (8).
- 5578 is not divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits (5 + 5 + 7 + 8) is not divisible by 3.
- 5578 is not divisible by 5 because it does not end in 0 or 5.
- 5578 is not divisible by 7 because the number 5578 - 2 × 7 = 5564 is not divisible by 7.
- 5578 is not divisible by 11 because the alternating sum of its digits (5 - 5 + 7 - 8) is not divisible by 11.

We can continue this process for other prime numbers, but as 5578 is a relatively large number, it is more efficient to use other methods. However, based on the initial checks, we can conclude that 5578 is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to 74.

Therefore, 5578 can be considered as a potential prime number, but further calculations are required to determine its primality definitively.

Continuing this process for all numbers up to the square root of 5578 will confirm whether or not it is a composite number. 

However, we can stop here and conclude that 5578 is a prime number since we have checked all numbers up to the square root without finding any factors. 

Therefore, 5578 is not a composite number; it is a prime number.

On dividing 2458 by 3, we get a decimal value. 
2458 ÷ 3 ≈ 819.33

Similarly, on dividing 2458 by 5, we also get a decimal value. 
2458 ÷ 5 ≈ 491.6

Continuing this process, we can divide 2458 by other odd numbers like 7, 11, 13, etc. 

However, none of these divisions will give a whole number result. Hence, 2458 is not divisible by any numbers other than itself and 1.

Therefore, 2458 is not a prime number.

Let's start checking divisibility:

- 9663 is divisible by 2 because it ends with an even number (3). Hence, it is not a prime number.

Therefore, 9663 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 2.
###
Yes, 9663 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether 9663 is a composite number or not, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Next, we can sum up the digits of 9663: 9 + 6 + 6 + 3 = 24. The sum of the digits is not divisible by 3, so 9663 is not divisible by 3.

We can also apply a divisibility rule for 2. Since the last digit of 9663 is 3 (an odd number), it is not divisible by 2.

Now let's check if 9663 is divisible by 5. Since the last digit is not 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Continuing, we can check if 9663 is divisible by 7. By using a divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit (2 * 3) from the remaining digits (966). The result is 960 - 6 = 954, which is not divisible by 7.

We can also check divisibility by 11. By applying a divisibility rule for 11, we alternate subtracting and adding the digits. Starting from the right, we have 3 - 6 + 6 - 9 = -6. Since -6 is not divisible by 11, neither is 9663.

Based on these tests, 9663 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. Therefore, it is a prime number, not a composite number.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. The last digit of 6805 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can divide 6805 by the next few prime numbers: 3, 5, 7, 11. 
6805 divided by 3 gives a quotient of 2268 with a remainder of 1. 
6805 divided by 5 gives a quotient of 1361 with a remainder of 0. 

Since 6805 is divisible by 5, it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 6805 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether 6805 is a composite number, we need to check if it can be evenly divided by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

Step 2: Check divisibility of 6805 by prime numbers less than or equal to its square root. 

We can start by checking divisibility by 2. 6805 is not divisible by 2 because it does not end with an even number.

Next, let's check divisibility by 3. The sum of the digits of 6805 is 6 + 8 + 0 + 5 = 19. Since 19 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 6805 is not divisible by 3.

Moving on, let's check divisibility by 5. 6805 does not end with either 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Continuing, let's check divisibility by 7. To do this, we can use the trick of adding and subtracting multiples of 7. 68 + 2 * 7 = 82. Since 82 is not divisible by 7, we can infer that 6805 is not divisible by 7.

Lastly, we can check divisibility by 11 using the alternating sum of digits method. 6 - 8 + 0 - 5 = -7. Since -7 is not divisible by 11, we can conclude that 6805 is not divisible by 11.

Let's start dividing 3065 by numbers greater than 1 and less than or equal to 55:

3065 ÷ 2 = 1532.5
3065 ÷ 3 = 1021.67
3065 ÷ 4 = 766.25
3065 ÷ 5 = 613
3065 ÷ 6 = 510.83
...
3065 ÷ 55 = 55.73

We can see that 3065 is divisible by 5 and 55. Therefore, 3065 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 3065 is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself. In the case of 3065, it can be divided evenly by 5 and 613, in addition to 1 and itself.
###
To determine whether 3065 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can start by finding the prime factors of 3065. We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. 3065 is an odd number, and since it does not end in 0, 2 is not a factor of 3065.

Next, we can check if 3 is a factor of 3065. To do this, we add up the digits of 3065: 3 + 0 + 6 + 5 = 14. Since 14 is not divisible by 3, 3 is not a factor of 3065.

Continuing in the same way, we can check if 5 is a factor of 3065. 5 is not a factor of 3065 since it does not end in 0 or 5.

Lastly, we can check if 7 is a factor of 3065. To do this, we divide 3065 by 7. The quotient is not a whole number, so 7 is also not a factor of 3065.

Since we have checked all the numbers up to 7 and none of them are factors of 3065, we can conclude that 3065 is not a composite number but a prime number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes. 3065 is divisible by 613.
###
No, 6506 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 2, 3253, and 6506.
###
To determine if 6506 is a prime number, we need to test for divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 6506 (rounded up to the nearest whole number).

The square root of 6506 is approximately 80.72. So, we will test for divisibility by prime numbers up to 81.

Let's go through the divisibility tests:

1. Divide by 2: 6506 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.
   6506 ÷ 2 = 3253

2. Divide by 3: The sum of the digits of 6506 is 6 + 5 + 0 + 6 = 17, which is not divisible by 3.
   6506 ÷ 3 ≈ 2168.67

3. Divide by 5: The ones digit of 6506 is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Divide by 7: We can use long division to check divisibility by 7.
   6506 ÷ 7 ≈ 929.4
   Since 7 does not divide 6506 evenly, it is not divisible by 7.

5. Divide by 11: We can use long division to check divisibility by 11.
   6506 ÷ 11 ≈ 591.45
   Since 11 does not divide 6506 evenly, it is not divisible by 11.

6. Divide by 13: We can use long division to check divisibility by 13.
   6506 ÷ 13 = 500
   Since 13 divides 6506 evenly, it is divisible by 13.

Since 6506 is divisible by 13, it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 6506 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 6506 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

One way to do this is by checking its divisors. We can start with the smallest divisor, which is 2, and continue checking if any number up to the square root of 6506 is a divisor.

The square root of 6506 is approximately 80.65.

Let's test the divisibility of 6506 by numbers up to 80.

6506 ÷ 2 = 3253 (not divisible)
6506 ÷ 3 = 2168.67 (not divisible)
6506 ÷ 4 = 1626.5 (not divisible)
6506 ÷ 5 = 1301.2 (not divisible)
and so on...

We can see that none of the numbers up to 80 divides 6506 evenly, which means 6506 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 6506 is a prime number, not a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes
###
No, 5001 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3 and 1667, in addition to 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 5001 is a prime number, we can check for factors of the number.

Starting with the lowest possible factor, which is 2, we check if 5001 is divisible by 2. If it is divisible, then 5001 is not a prime number.

Dividing 5001 by 2 gives us a quotient of 2500.5, which is not a whole number. Therefore, 5001 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check for factors up to the square root of 5001, which is approximately 70.7. We will check odd numbers starting from 3 since we already know 5001 is not divisible by 2.

Dividing 5001 by 3 gives us a quotient of 1667, which is also not a whole number. Continuing this process, we check for divisibility by 5, 7, and so on, until we reach approximately 70.

However, if we check all the way up to 70 and find no factors, then 5001 is a prime number.

In this case, when checking all the possible factors, we find that 5001 is divisible by 3. Dividing 5001 by 3 gives us a quotient of 1667, which is a whole number.

Therefore, we can conclude that 5001 is not a prime number since it is divisible by 3.
###
Yes, 5001 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 5001 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if 5001 is divisible by 2. If we divide 5001 by 2, we get a result of 2500 with a remainder of 1.

Next, we can check if 5001 is divisible by 3. If we add up the digits of 5001, we get 5 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 6. Since 6 is divisible by 3, we know that 5001 is also divisible by 3. If we divide 5001 by 3, we get a result of 1667 with no remainder.

Therefore, the factors of 5001 are 1, 5001, 3, and 1667. Since 5001 has factors other than 1 and itself, it is a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes.
###
No, 5255 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 5 and 1051.
###
To determine if 5255 is a prime number, we can begin by dividing it by all prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 5255 (√5255 ≈ 72.49). 

Starting with the smallest prime number, 2, we divide 5255 by 2. If the division results in an integer without a remainder, then 5255 is not prime. In this case, 5255 ÷ 2 = 2627.5, which is not an integer.

We continue checking with the following prime numbers: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, and 71. 

At no point does any division yield an integer. Therefore, we can conclude that 5255 is a prime number since it is not divisible evenly by any prime numbers up to its square root.
###
Yes, 5255 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 5255 is a composite number, we need to find its factors. 

We start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If we divide 5255 by 2, we get 2627.75, which is not a whole number. Therefore, 5255 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits, 5 + 2 + 5 + 5 = 17, is not divisible by 3. Hence, 5255 is not divisible by 3.

Then, we check if it is divisible by 4. Since the last two digits of 5255 are not divisible by 4, the whole number is also not divisible by 4.

We can continue this process for higher prime numbers, but considering 5255 is already not divisible by 2, 3, or 4, it is safe to conclude that it is not divisible by any prime numbers and therefore is not a composite number.

Therefore, 5255 is a prime number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes, 5255 is divisible by 1051.
###
No, 7642 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2 and 3821.
###
To determine if 7642 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

First, let's check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit of 7642 is 2, which is an even number, we know that 7642 is divisible by 2.

Therefore, 7642 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 7642 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether 7642 is a composite number, we need to factorize it.

The first step is to check for divisibility by small prime numbers. Starting from 2, we divide 7642 by each prime number until we find a divisor or reach the square root of 7642.

7642 ÷ 2 = 3821
7642 ÷ 3 = not divisible
7642 ÷ 5 = not divisible
7642 ÷ 7 = not divisible
7642 ÷ 11 = not divisible
7642 ÷ 13 = not divisible
7642 ÷ 17 = not divisible
7642 ÷ 19 = not divisible
7642 ÷ 23 = not divisible
7642 ÷ 29 = not divisible
7642 ÷ 31 = not divisible
7642 ÷ 37 = not divisible

We continue dividing by each prime number until the square root of 7642, but we don't find any divisor.

Since there are no smaller factors to consider, we can conclude that 7642 is a prime number, not a composite number.
###
Yes
###
Yes.
###
No, 6658 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 2 and 3329.
###
To determine if 6658 is a prime number, we can use the divisibility test. 

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2
Since 6658 ends in an even number, it is divisible by 2.

Step 2: Check divisibility by 3
To check if 6658 is divisible by 3, we add up its digits: 6 + 6 + 5 + 8 = 25. Since 25 is not divisible by 3, neither is 6658.

Step 3: Check divisibility by 5
Since 6658 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Step 4: Check divisibility by 7
To check if 6658 is divisible by 7, we can use the divisibility rule for 7: multiply the last digit (8) by 2, then subtract it from the remaining digits (665). If the result is divisible by 7, then so is the original number. 

8 x 2 = 16
665 - 16 = 649

Since 649 is not divisible by 7, neither is 6658.

Step 5: Check divisibility by 11
To check if 6658 is divisible by 11, we can use the divisibility rule: subtract the number formed by alternatingly adding and subtracting digits, starting with a plus sign. 

6 - 6 + 5 - 8 = -3

Since -3 is not divisible by 11, neither is 6658.

Since 6658 is divisible by 2, it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 6658 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 6658 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Find the square root of 6658.
√6658 ≈ 81.65

Step 2: Check for factors up to the square root.
Checking for factors up to 81, we find that 6658 is divisible by 2 and 37, as 6658 ÷ 2 = 3329 and 6658 ÷ 37 = 180.

Thus, 6658 has factors other than 1 and itself, making it a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes.
###
No, 5086 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by smaller numbers such as 2, 7, and 727.
###
To determine if 5086 is a prime number, we can check for factors by dividing it by numbers up to its square root. 

The square root of 5086 is approximately 71.30. We can start by checking if it is divisible evenly by 2, as even numbers are always divisible by 2. 

5086 divided by 2 equals 2543, which is not a whole number. 

Next, we can check for divisibility by odd numbers up to 71. 

Dividing by 3 does not yield a whole number. 

Dividing by 5 also does not give a whole number. 

Dividing by 7 does not produce a whole number either. 

Continuing this process for the odd numbers up to 71, we find that 5086 is not divisible by any of them. 

Therefore, we can conclude that 5086 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. 

Hence, we can say that 5086 is a prime number.
###
No, 5086 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
###
To determine if 5086 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can start by finding the prime factorization of 5086.

First, we can check if 2 is a factor of 5086. Since 5086 is an even number (ends in 6), we know it is divisible by 2.

5086 ÷ 2 = 2543

So, 2 is a factor of 5086.

Next, we continue dividing by prime numbers until we can't divide anymore.

2543 is not divisible by 2, but let's check if it is divisible by 3.

2543 ÷ 3 = 847.666...

Since 2543 is not divisible by 3 without a remainder, we try the next prime number, which is 5.

2543 ÷ 5 = 508.6

Again, there is a remainder, so we move on to the next prime number. The next prime number is 7.

2543 ÷ 7 = 363.285...

Still, there is a remainder, so we try the next prime number, which is 11.

2543 ÷ 11 = 231.181...

Again, there is a remainder, so we continue with the next prime number, which is 13.

2543 ÷ 13 = 195.615...

Still, there is a remainder, so we try the next prime number, which is 17.

Again, there is a remainder, so we continue with the next prime number, which is 29.

2543 ÷ 29 = 87.689...

Still, there is a remainder, so we try the next prime number, which is 31.

2543 ÷ 31 = 82.032...

Again, there is a remainder, so we continue with the next prime number, which is 37.

2543 ÷ 37 = 68.676...

Still, there is a remainder, so we try the next prime number, which is 41.

2543 ÷ 41 = 62.024...

Again, there is a remainder, so we continue with the next prime number, which is 43.

2543 ÷ 43 = 59.093...

Still, there is a remainder, so we try the next prime number, which is 47.

2543 ÷ 47 = 54.064...

Again, there is a remainder, so we continue with the next prime number, which is 53.

2543 ÷ 53 = 47.981...

Still, there is a remainder, so we try the next prime number, which is 59.

2543 ÷ 59 = 43.068...

Again, there is a remainder, so we continue with the next prime number, which is 61.

2543 ÷ 61 = 41.689...

Still, there is a remainder, so we try the next prime number, which is 67.

2543 ÷ 67 = 37.955...

Again, there is a remainder, so we continue with the next prime number, which is 71.

2543 ÷ 71 = 35.84...

Still, there is a remainder, so we try the next prime number, which is 73.

2543 ÷ 73 = 34.849...

Again, there is a remainder, so we continue with the next prime number, which is 79.

2543 ÷ 79 = 32.194...

Still, there is a remainder, so we try the next prime number, which is 83.

2543 ÷ 83 = 30.634...

Again, there is a remainder, so we continue with the next prime number, which is 89.

2543 ÷ 89 = 28.547...

Still, there is a remainder, so we try the next prime number, which is 97.

2543 ÷ 97 = 26.216...

Again, there is a remainder, so we continue with the next prime number, which is 101.

2543 ÷ 101 = 25.178...

Still, there is a remainder, but at this point, we can conclude that we have checked all prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 2543 (approximately 50.4).

Since we have not found any factors other than 1 and 2543, it means that 5086 is a composite number.

###
No, 5195 is not a prime number. It can be divided by 5 and 103, so it is not only divisible by 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 5195 is a prime number, we can try to divide it by all numbers from 2 up to the square root of 5195. If any of these divisions result in an integer quotient, then 5195 is not a prime number.

The square root of 5195 is approximately 72.07, so we only need to check for divisibility up to 72.

Let's try dividing 5195 by each number from 2 to 72:

5195 ÷ 2 = 2597.5 (not an integer)
5195 ÷ 3 = 1731.666... (not an integer)
5195 ÷ 4 = 1298.75 (not an integer)
.
.
.
5195 ÷ 71 = 73.028... (not an integer)
5195 ÷ 72 = 72.152... (not an integer)

Since none of these divisions resulted in an integer quotient, we can conclude that 5195 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 5195 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 5195 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: To find the factors of 5195, we can divide it by numbers starting from 2 and going up to the square root of 5195, which is approximately 72.02.

Step 2: Trying to divide 5195 by 2, we find that it is not divisible evenly.

Step 3: Continuing with the next number, 3, we find that 5195 is again not divisible by 3 without any remainder.

Step 4: Trying 4, 5, 6, and so on, we continue to find that 5195 is not divisible evenly by any of these numbers.

Step 5: The largest number we need to test is the square root of 5195, which is approximately 72.02. But we don't need to check this number since we have already checked numbers smaller than it.

Step 6: Since we have checked all possible factors and found that 5195 is not divisible evenly by any of them, we can conclude that 5195 is a prime number.

Therefore, 5195 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.

No, 6835 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 5 and 1367.
###
To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

In this case, we can start by checking if 6835 is divisible by 2. Since 6835 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if 6835 is divisible by any odd numbers up to its square root, which is approximately 82.7. We don't need to go beyond the square root because if a number is divisible by a larger number, it must also be divisible by a smaller number.

Starting with 3, we can check if 6835 is divisible by each odd number until 83.
###
Yes, 6835 is a composite number.

###
No, 1141 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 11 and 103.
###
To determine if 1141 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, let's check if it is divisible by 2. If the number ends in an even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), then it is divisible by 2. However, since 1141 does not end in an even digit, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check if it is divisible by 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 1141 is 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 1141 is not divisible by 3.

Now, let's check if it is divisible by any prime number between 5 and the square root of 1141 (approximately 33.7). We can check divisibility by 5 by checking if the number ends in 0 or 5. However, as 1141 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

We can continue this process for other prime numbers, but since 1141 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, we can conclude that it is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

Therefore, we can conclude that 1141 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 1141 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To find the factors of 1141, we need to check all numbers from 2 up to the square root of 1141, which is approximately 33.77. 

Starting with 2, we can divide 1141 by each number and see if the result is a whole number. 

If we continue this process until 33, we will find that 1141 is not divisible by any of these numbers between 2 and 33. 

Since we have not found any factors other than 1 and 1141, we can conclude that 1141 is a prime number and not a composite number.
###
No.
###
Yes, 1141 is divisible by 163.
###
No, 3153 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking if 3153 is divisible by 2. Since 3153 ends in an odd number (3) and the sum of its digits (3 + 1 + 5 + 3 = 12) is not divisible by 3, we can already conclude that 3153 is not divisible by 2 or 3.

Next, we can check for divisibility by other prime numbers up to the square root of 3153 (which is approximately 56). 

Checking for divisibility by 5, the last digit of 3153 is not 0 or 5, so 3153 is not divisible by 5.

Checking for divisibility by 7, we can use the divisibility rule for 7, which states that if the difference between twice the units digit and the remaining digits is divisible by 7, then the number is divisible by 7. In this case, the units digit is 3, and twice 3 equals 6. Subtracting 6 from the remaining digits (315), we get a difference of 309, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, we can conclude that 3153 is not divisible by 7.

Continuing this process for other prime numbers up to approximately 56, we find that 3153 is not divisible by any of them. Therefore, we can conclude that 3153 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 3153 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it can be divided evenly by any number other than 1 and itself.

Let's check the divisibility of 3153 by numbers between 2 and the square root of 3153.

The square root of 3153 is approximately 56.12, so we can check divisibility up to 56.

Starting from 2, we check if 3153 is divisible by each number.

3153 ÷ 2 = 1576.5      (not divisible)
3153 ÷ 3 = 1051           (not divisible)
3153 ÷ 4 = 788.25      (not divisible)
3153 ÷ 5 = 630.6        (not divisible)
3153 ÷ 6 = 525.5        (not divisible)
3153 ÷ 7 = 450.43     (not divisible)
.
.
.
3153 ÷ 55 = 57.327   (not divisible)
3153 ÷ 56 = 56.16     (not divisible)

As we can see, 3153 is not divisible evenly by any number other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 3153 is not a composite number; it is a prime number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes
###
No, 8013 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3 and 2671.
###
To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Let's try to find factors of 8013. We will check all numbers up to the square root of 8013, which is approximately 89.45 (rounded up to 90).

Starting with 2, we check if it divides 8013 evenly:
8013 ÷ 2 = 4006 remainder 1

Since 2 does not divide 8013 evenly, we move on to the next number, which is 3:
8013 ÷ 3 = 2671 remainder 0

Here, 3 divides 8013 evenly, so we have found a factor. This means that 8013 is not a prime number.

In conclusion, 8013 is not a prime number as it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 8013 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can start by finding the square root of 8013. If the number is composite, there will be at least one factor less than or equal to the square root. 

The square root of 8013 is approximately 89.5 (rounded to one decimal place). 

Next, we can check if any numbers less than or equal to 89.5 divide evenly into 8013. 

By performing this calculation, we find that 8013 is divisible by 3 (8013 ÷ 3 = 2671). 

Therefore, 8013 has at least one factor other than 1 and itself and is considered a composite number.
###
Yes, 8013 is divisible by 3.
###
Yes
###
No, 3651 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can start by checking if there are any factors of 3651 between 2 and the square root of 3651 (rounded up to the nearest whole number).

The square root of 3651 is approximately 60.41, so we only need to check for factors between 2 and 60.

Now, let's check:

- 2: 3651 is not divisible by 2.
- 3: The sum of the digits in 3651 is 3+6+5+1 = 15, which is divisible by 3, so 3651 is divisible by 3.
- 4: 3651 is not divisible by 4.
- 5: The last digit of 3651 is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
- 6: 3651 is already found to be divisible by 3, so it is also divisible by 6 (a multiple of 3).
- 7: We can try dividing it but it is not divisible
- 8: 3651 is not divisible by 8.
- 9: The sum of the digits in 3651 is 15, which is divisible by 9, so 3651 is also divisible by 9.
- 10 and above: We don't need to check for factors greater than 9 because if there were any factors in this range, we would have already found them.

Therefore, we have found that 3651 is divisible by both 3 and 9, meaning it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 3651 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 3651 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we check if 2 is a factor of 3651. Since 2 does not divide 3651 (3651 ÷ 2 = 1825.5), we move on to the next number.

Next, we check if 3 is a factor of 3651. By performing the digit sum test (3 + 6 + 5 + 1 = 15, and 15 ÷ 3 = 5), we see that 3 divides evenly into 3651. Therefore, 3 is a factor of 3651.

Since 3 is a factor of 3651, we can see that 3651 is not a prime number because it has factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 3651 is a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes.
###
No, 1959 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 1959 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit of 1959 is odd (9), it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. By adding up the digits of 1959 (1 + 9 + 5 + 9 = 24), we can see that 1959 is not divisible by 3.

Since 1959 is not divisible by 2 or 3, let's continue checking for divisibility by higher numbers. However, instead of checking every possible divisor, we can take the square root of 1959 and round it up to the nearest whole number. The square root of 1959 is approximately 44.23, so we can check divisibility up to 45.

Now, by checking numbers from 5 to 45, we can see that 1959 is divisible by 13 (1959 ÷ 13 = 151).

Since 1959 is divisible by 13, it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 1959 is a composite number. It is divisible by 3 and 653, apart from 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 1959 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can start by checking for factors up to the square root of 1959, which is approximately 44.25.

We'll start by dividing 1959 by 2. 1959 divided by 2 equals 979.5, which is not an integer. 

Next, we'll try dividing 1959 by 3. 1959 divided by 3 equals 653, which is not an integer.

Then, we'll divide 1959 by 4, which is also not a factor.

We'll keep dividing by increasing numbers until we reach the square root of 1959. 

Continuing this process, we find that 1959 is not divisible by any number between 2 and 44.25 without leaving a fraction or decimal. 

Therefore, we can conclude that 1959 is a prime number and not a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes.
###
Yes, 2513 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 2513 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

The square root of 2513 is approximately 50.13. 

We will now check if 2513 is divisible by prime numbers less than 50. 

Starting with 2: 2513 is not divisible by 2 since it is an odd number.
Next, we check 3: 2+5+1+3 = 11 which is not divisible by 3. So, 2513 is not divisible by 3.
Next, we check 5: 2513 is not divisible by 5 as it does not end in 0 or 5.
Next, we check 7: 25 - 1(3) = 22 which is not divisible by 7. 
Next, we check 11: 2 - 5 + 1 - 3 = -5 which is not divisible by 11.
Next, we check 13: 25 + 1 - 3 = 23 which is not divisible by 13.
Next, we check 17: 25 - 1 + 3 = 27 which is not divisible by 17.

Continue checking prime numbers until reaching the square root of 2513: 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, and 47.

Since 2513 is not divisible by any of the prime numbers less than its square root, we can conclude that 2513 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 2513 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Let's start by finding the factors of 2513:

1 is always a factor of any number.

2513 divided by 1 gives us 2513.

Since 2513 divided by any number other than 1 gives us a decimal or non-integer quotient, it means that there are no other whole number factors of 2513.

Therefore, 2513 is not divisible by any whole number other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 2513 is a prime number, not a composite number.
###

###
No
###
Yes, 5755 is a prime number.
###
To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Even numbers other than 2 are not prime, therefore we can immediately rule out numbers ending in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.

Step 2: We can check divisibility by 3 by summing the digits of the number and checking if the sum is divisible by 3. In this case, 5 + 7 + 5 + 5 = 22, which is not divisible by 3.

Step 3: Next, we can check numbers ending in 5. Since 5755 ends in 5, it is not prime.

Therefore, 5755 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 5755 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 5755 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can start dividing 5755 by numbers greater than 1 and less than or equal to its square root, which is approximately 75.9.

After testing a few numbers, we find that 5755 is divisible by 5 (5755 ÷ 5 = 1151). 

Therefore, 5755 is a composite number since it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###

###
To determine whether 1754 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 1754 is even (ends with a 4), it is divisible by 2. 

1754 divided by 2 is equal to 877. 

Therefore, 1754 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 2.
###
Yes, 1754 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 1754 is a composite number, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can attempt to divide 1754 by various numbers starting from 2 and going up to the square root of 1754 (approximately 41.9).

Checking divisibility by numbers between 2 and 41.9, we find that 1754 is divisible by 2, as 1754 ÷ 2 equals 877.

Therefore, since 1754 has factors other than 1 and itself (2 and 877), it is a composite number.

###
To determine if 6938 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. 

First, we check for divisibility by 2. Since 6938 is an even number (it ends in 8), it is divisible by 2.

6938 divided by 2 equals 3469.

Since we found a factor of 2, we know that 6938 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 6938 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. Let's perform the divisibility test.

First, we need to find the square root of 6938. The square root of 6938 is approximately 83.36. 

Now, we will check if 6938 is divisible by any number between 2 and 83.

By checking the divisibility, we find that 6938 is divisible by 2. The division 6938 ÷ 2 gives us 3469.

Now, we need to check if 3469 is divisible by any number between 2 and its square root (approximately 58.91).

By checking the divisibility, we find that 3469 is not divisible by any number between 2 and 58.

Therefore, 6938 is a composite number because it is divisible by 2 and at least one other number (3469).

###
To determine if 1082 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Let's start by checking if it is divisible by 2. Since 1082 is an even number, it is divisible by 2.

1082 ÷ 2 = 541

Since 1082 is divisible by 2, it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 1082 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2
The number 1082 is even, so it is divisible by 2. Dividing 1082 by 2 gives us 541, which is a prime number.

Step 2: Check divisibility by other odd numbers
We can skip checking divisibility by odd numbers because we know that 1082 is divisible by 2.

Since 1082 is divisible by 2 only, and it is not divisible by any other number, it is not a composite number. It is actually a prime number.

Yes, 2157 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 3 and 719.
###
To determine if 2157 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can divide 2157 by numbers from 2 to the square root of 2157 (rounded up to the nearest whole number), which is approximately 46.52.

Let's check:

2157 ÷ 2 = 1078.5
2157 ÷ 3 = 719
2157 ÷ 4 = 539.25
2157 ÷ 5 = 431.4
2157 ÷ 6 = 359.5
2157 ÷ 7 = 308.142857
2157 ÷ 8 = 269.625
2157 ÷ 9 = 239.666667
2157 ÷ 10 = 215.7
...
2157 ÷ 46 ≈ 46.89

None of the divisions gave us whole numbers. Thus, 2157 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Hence, we can conclude that 2157 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 2157 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 2157 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can start by finding its prime factors. The prime factorization of 2157 can be found by dividing it by prime numbers starting from 2.

2157 ÷ 2 = 1078 remainder 1
2157 ÷ 3 = 719 remainder 0
719 ÷ 3 = 239 remainder 2
239 ÷ 3 = 79 remainder 2
79 ÷ 3 = 26 remainder 1
26 ÷ 2 = 13 remainder 0

From the above calculations, we have found the prime factorization of 2157 as 3 × 3 × 239.

Since 2157 has factors other than 1 and itself (3 × 3 × 239), it is considered a composite number.

###
No, 9874 is not a prime number. It can be divisible by 2, 4937, and 19748.
###
To check if a number is prime, we need to divide it by all the numbers less than it and greater than 1.

So, let's start by checking if 9874 is divisible by 2.
###
Yes, 9874 is a composite number. It can be expressed as the product of its factors: 2 * 4937.
###
To determine if 9874 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Let's check its divisibility by numbers up to its square root (√9874 ≈ 99.37).

First, we check divisibility by 2. Since 9874 is an even number (the last digit is 4), it is indeed divisible by 2.

9874 ÷ 2 = 4937

Next, we check divisibility by 3. This can be done by adding up the digits of 9874 and checking if the sum is divisible by 3.

9 + 8 + 7 + 4 = 28

28 is not divisible by 3, so 9874 is not divisible by 3.

Checking divisibility by 4, we observe that since 9874 is divisible by 2 (as shown before), it is also divisible by 4.

9874 ÷ 4 = 2468.5

Lastly, we check divisibility by 5. If the last digit of a number is either 0 or 5, then the number is divisible by 5. However, as the last digit of 9874 is 4, it is not divisible by 5.

Since 9874 is divisible by numbers other than 1 and itself, such as 2 and 4, it is a composite number.
###
Yes
###
No.
###
No, 8259 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 8259 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

Step 1: Calculate the square root of 8259. The square root of 8259 is approximately 90.84.

Step 2: Check divisibility. Starting with the smallest prime number, which is 2, check if 8259 is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is not a prime number. 8259 is not divisible by 2.

Step 3: Continue checking divisibility with the next prime number, 3. Again, check if 8259 is divisible by 3. If it is, then it is not a prime number. 8259 is not divisible by 3.

Step 4: Check divisibility with the next prime number, 5. If 8259 is divisible by 5, it is not a prime number. 8259 is not divisible by 5.

Step 5: Repeat this process with prime numbers 7, 11, 13, and so on until reaching the square root of 8259 (90.84).

After checking all the prime numbers up to the square root of 8259, if none of them divide 8259, then 8259 is a prime number.

Conclusion: Based on the steps above, after checking all prime numbers up to the square root of 8259, we can conclude that 8259 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 8259 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself.

Starting with the number 8259, we can begin checking for potential factors. We can start by checking divisibility by 2.

8259 is an odd number, which means it is not divisible by 2. Moving on, we can check for divisibility by 3.

To check divisibility by 3, we can sum the digits of 8259. 

8 + 2 + 5 + 9 = 24

Since 24 is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 8259 is also divisible by 3.

Now, let's divide 8259 by 3 to see if there are any remaining factors.

8259 / 3 = 2753

2753 is another odd number, so it is not divisible by 2. We can continue checking for other possible factors, but we notice that 2753 is also a prime number. Therefore, 8259 only has two factors, 1 and itself.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that 8259 is a prime number, not a composite number.
###

###
No
###
No, 6098 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2 and 3049.
###
To determine if 6098 is a prime number, we can use a divisibility test. 
First, we know that a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2 - If a number is even, it is not prime.
Since 6098 ends with an even digit (8), it is divisible by 2.

Therefore, 6098 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 6098 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether 6098 is a composite number, we need to find if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To begin, let's try dividing 6098 by 2: 6098 ÷ 2 ≈ 3049. 

Since the result is not a whole number, 2 is not a factor of 6098.

Next, we can try dividing by 3, which is another prime number: 6098 ÷ 3 ≈ 2032.6667.

Again, the result is not a whole number, so 3 is not a factor either.

Continuing with this process, we can test 4, 5, 6, and so on, up to the square root of 6098 (which is approximately 78.084), but it is worth noting that all even numbers greater than 2, including 4, can be skipped as factors.

Finally, after going through this process, we find that 6098 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, we can conclude that 6098 is a prime number, not a composite number.
###
Yes
###
Yes
###
No, 3099 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3 and 1033.
###
To check if 3099 is a prime number, we need to verify if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

First, we take the square root of 3099, which is approximately 55.67. Hence, we only need to check for divisors up to 55.

Now, we begin checking for divisors. We divide 3099 by prime numbers starting from 2:

3099 ÷ 2 = 1549.5 (not an integer)
3099 ÷ 3 = 1033 (not an integer)
3099 ÷ 5 = 619.8 (not an integer)
3099 ÷ 7 = 442.7 (not an integer)
3099 ÷ 11 = 281.727 (not an integer)

Therefore, yes, 3099 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 3099 is a composite number. A composite number is defined as any positive integer greater than 1 that is divisible by at least one positive integer other than itself and 1. In the case of 3099, it can be divided evenly by 3 and 1039, apart from 1 and itself. Therefore, it is a composite number.
###
Yes, 3099 is a composite number. 

To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if 3099 is divisible by 2. If we divide 3099 by 2, we get 1549.5, which is not a whole number. Therefore, 3099 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if 3099 is divisible by 3. By adding up the digits of 3099 (3 + 0 + 9 + 9 = 21), we find that 3099 is divisible by 3 because 21 is divisible by 3. If we divide 3099 by 3, we get 1033, which is a whole number.

Therefore, we have found that 3099 is divisible by 3, which means it has factors other than 1 and itself. Hence, 3099 is a composite number.

###
No, 2734 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2 and 1367.
###
To determine if 2734 is a prime number, we can check if it is divisible by any whole numbers greater than 1 and less than its square root (rounded up to the nearest whole number).

First, we find the square root of 2734:

√2734 ≈ 52.329

Since we only need to check whole numbers, let's round up to the nearest whole number and use 53 for our calculations.

Next, we'll check if 2734 is divisible by any numbers from 2 to 53.

Dividing 2734 by 2 results in a remainder, so it is not divisible by 2.

Dividing 2734 by 3 also leaves a remainder.

Continuing this process, we find that 2734 is divisible by 7:

2734 ÷ 7 = 391

Therefore, 2734 is not a prime number since it is divisible by 7.
###
Yes, 2734 is a composite number. It can be factored into 2 * 7 * 13 * 31.
###
To determine if 2734 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

The first step is to find the prime factorization of 2734. We can start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

2734 ÷ 2 = 1367

We see that 1367 is not divisible by 2. So we proceed to the next prime number, which is 3.

1367 ÷ 3 = 455.67

Since 455.67 is not a whole number, we move on to the next prime number, which is 5.

1367 ÷ 5 = 273.4

Again, 273.4 is not a whole number. We proceed to the next prime number, which is 7.

1367 ÷ 7 = 195.29

195.29 is not a whole number either. We continue with the next prime number, which is 11.

1367 ÷ 11 = 124.27

We still do not have a whole number. We proceed to the next prime number, which is 13.

1367 ÷ 13 = 105.15

Again, 105.15 is not a whole number. We continue with the next prime number, which is 17.

1367 ÷ 17 = 80.41

80.41 is not a whole number. We move on to the next prime number, which is 19.

1367 ÷ 19 = 71.95

71.95 is not a whole number. We proceed to the next prime number, which is 23.

1367 ÷ 23 = 59.43

59.43 is not a whole number either. We continue dividing by prime numbers until we reach the square root of 1367, which is approximately 36.97.

After checking all prime numbers up to the square root of 1367, we can conclude that 2734 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.

###
Yes, 2734 is divisible by 1367.
###
No, 7846 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 7846 is a prime number, we need to check if it is evenly divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we check if it is divisible by 2. Since it ends in an even number (6), we know it is divisible by 2. 

7846 ÷ 2 = 3923

So, 7846 is divisible by 2. Therefore, it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 7846 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 7846 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Prime numbers are only divisible by 1 and themselves, so 7846 can't be a prime number.

Step 2: To check for divisibility, we can start dividing 7846 by prime numbers. Let's start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.

7846 ÷ 2 = 3923

Since 7846 is not divisible by 2 evenly, we move on to the next prime number, which is 3.

7846 ÷ 3 = 2615.333...

Again, not divisible evenly by 3. Let's try the next prime number, which is 5.

7846 ÷ 5 = 1569.2

Still not divisible evenly by 5. Let's try the next prime number, which is 7.

7846 ÷ 7 = 1120.857...

Not divisible evenly by 7 either. We can continue testing with larger prime numbers, but by this point, it is clear that 7846 is not divisible by any prime numbers up to its square root (88.54810518).

Therefore, 7846 is not a composite number, since it cannot be divided evenly by any numbers other than 1 and itself.
###

###
Yes.
###
No, 2594 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 2594 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If the number ends in an even number, it is divisible by 2. However, 2594 does not end in an even number, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To determine if a number is divisible by 3, we can add up its digits and if the sum is divisible by 3, then the number is divisible by 3. 

2 + 5 + 9 + 4 = 20

Since 20 is not divisible by 3, 2594 is not divisible by 3.

Now, we can check divisibility by 5. If a number ends in 0 or 5, then it is divisible by 5. However, since 2594 does not end in either 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Since 2594 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, we can conclude that it is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 2594.

Therefore, we can determine that 2594 is a prime number, since it does not have any divisors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 2594 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 2594 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by finding the prime factors of 2594. We can divide it by prime numbers starting from 2 and continue until the quotient cannot be divided any further.

2594 divided by 2 is 1297. 

1297 is a prime number because it cannot be divided evenly by any other number besides 1 and itself.

Step 2: Factors
Now, let's check if there are any factors of 2594 other than 1 and itself. 

Since 2594 only has 2 and 1297 as factors, and no other factors, we can conclude that 2594 is a prime number, not a composite number.

No, 2218 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2 and 7.
###
To determine if 2218 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

The square root of 2218 is approximately 47.1.

Let's check if 2218 is divisible by any prime numbers between 2 and 47:

2218 ÷ 2 = 1109 (not divisible)
2218 ÷ 3 = 739.33 (not divisible)

###
Yes, 2218 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by checking if 2218 is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is not a prime number.

2218 ÷ 2 = 1109

Since 2218 divided by 2 is not a whole number, we can conclude that 2218 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if 2218 is divisible by odd numbers starting from 3 and going up to the square root of 2218 (approximately 47).

We can manually check each odd number if it divides 2218 evenly. If we find a divisor other than 1 and 2218, then 2218 is composite. If we do not find any such divisor, then 2218 is prime.

No, 5065 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 5065 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, let's check if it is divisible by 2. 5065 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 5065 is 5+0+6+5=16. Since 16 is not divisible by 3, 5065 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue checking divisibility by prime numbers such as 5, 7, 11, and so on, but it is more efficient to check divisibility up to the square root of 5065. 

The square root of 5065 is approximately 71.19. We can check divisibility by all prime numbers up to 71.

Checking divisibility by primes up to 71, we find that 5065 is divisible by 5, as 5065/5 = 1013. Since 5 is a factor of 5065 other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that 5065 is not a prime number.

Therefore, 5065 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 5065 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Firstly, we can check if 5065 is divisible by 2. If it is divisible by 2, then it is not a prime number.

However, 5065 is an odd number, and it is not divisible by 2 since the last digit is not even.

Next, we can check if 5065 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add the individual digits (5 + 0 + 6 + 5 = 16) and see if the sum is divisible by 3. Here, 16 is not divisible by 3, so neither is 5065.

Continuing, we can check for divisibility by 5. If the last digit is either 0 or 5, then the number is divisible by 5. However, the last digit of 5065 is 5, so it is divisible by 5.

Therefore, we can conclude that 5065 is a composite number since it is divisible by 5 and has additional factors other than 1 and itself.

Yes.
###
Yes, 4319 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 4319 is a prime number, we can check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, let's check if it is divisible by 2. Since 4319 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we continue.

Next, let's check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up the digits of 4319 and see if the sum is divisible by 3. In this case, 4 + 3 + 1 + 9 = 17, which is not divisible by 3.

Then, let's check if it is divisible by 5. Since 4319 does not end with 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Now, let's check if it is divisible by any other prime numbers less than its square root. To do this, we can divide 4319 by prime numbers starting from 7 and increasing gradually. 

After trying several prime numbers, we can conclude that there are no prime divisors of 4319 less than its square root. Hence, 4319 does not have any divisors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, we can confirm that 4319 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 4319 is a composite number. It is divisible by numbers other than 1 and itself.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To find factors of 4319, we can start by checking if any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 4319 divide it evenly. If they do, then the number is composite. 

Let's start with the prime number 2:

4319 ÷ 2 = 2159.5

Since 2159.5 is not a whole number, we can conclude that 2 is not a factor of 4319. 

Next, let's try 3:

4319 ÷ 3 = 1439.666...

Again, we get a non-whole number. 

We can continue testing with other prime numbers, but we can already see that 4319 does not have any small prime factors.

To determine if 2807 is a prime number, we can check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. We can start by checking all the numbers up to the square root of 2807, which is approximately 53.

We divide 2807 by all the numbers from 2 to 53. If any of them divide evenly into 2807, then 2807 is not a prime number. If none of them divide evenly, then 2807 is a prime number.

Let's perform the calculations:

2807 ÷ 2 = 1403.5 (not an integer)
2807 ÷ 3 = 935.6667 (not an integer)
2807 ÷ 4 = 701.75 (not an integer)
.
.
.
2807 ÷ 53 = 52.8302 (not an integer)

Since none of the numbers from 2 to 53 divide evenly into 2807, we can conclude that 2807 is a prime number.

###
Yes, 2807 is a composite number because it has divisors other than 1 and itself. Specifically, it can be divided by 17 and 19.
###
To determine if 2807 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

The square root of 2807 is approximately 53. 

Performing the division, we find that 2807 is not divisible by any numbers between 2 and 53. 

Therefore, 2807 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. 

Therefore, we can conclude that 2807 is a prime number, not a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
To determine if 2807 is divisible by 401, we need to check if 2807 is a multiple of 401 without any remainder.

Let's calculate:

2807 divided by 401 equals 7 with a remainder of 38.

Since there is a remainder of 38, we can conclude that 2807 is not divisible by 401.

Therefore, the answer is No.
###
Yes, 5601 is a prime number.
###
To check if 5601 is a prime number or not, we need to divide it by all numbers from 2 up to its square root (rounded up to the nearest whole number), which is approximately 74.83.

Starting with 2, we can check if there is any divisor of 5601. 

Dividing 5601 by 2 gives a quotient of 2800.5, which is not a whole number, so 2 is not a divisor. 

Dividing 5601 by 3 gives a quotient of 1867, which is also not a whole number, so 3 is not a divisor. 

Dividing 5601 by 4, 5, 6, ... up to 74, we find that none of these numbers divide 5601 evenly, producing whole number quotients. 

Therefore, we can conclude that 5601 is a prime number because it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 5601 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether 5601 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors besides 1 and itself.

We can start by finding the square root of 5601, which is approximately 74.89. 

Next, we can check if any numbers between 2 and 74 divide evenly into 5601.

Upon examining these numbers, we find that 5601 is not divisible by any of them. 

Therefore, we can conclude that 5601 is a prime number, not a composite number.

Yes, 8781 is a prime number.
###
To determine whether 8781 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 8781 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can proceed to check for divisibility by odd numbers.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we sum the digits of 8781: 8 + 7 + 8 + 1 = 24. Since 24 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 8781 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue checking for divisibility by other prime numbers in a similar manner, but there is a more efficient method to check for primality.

To determine if 8781 is a prime number, we can perform a trial division by checking all prime numbers up to the square root of 8781. The square root of 8781 is approximately 93.71, so we only need to check prime numbers up to 93.

Checking divisibility by prime numbers up to 93:

- 8781 is not divisible by 2 or 3.
- It is not divisible by 5, since it does not end with 0 or 5.
- It is not divisible by 7, as 8781 is not a multiple of 7.
- It is not divisible by 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, or 89.

Therefore, we have checked all prime numbers up to 93 and found that none of them divide evenly into 8781. Hence, 8781 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 8781 is a composite number. It can be divided evenly by 1, 7, 1253, and 8781 itself.

###
To determine if 1934 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we check if it is divisible by 2. 1934 divided by 2 equals 967, which is not a whole number. 

Next, we check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 1934 is 1 + 9 + 3 + 4 = 17. Since 17 is not divisible by 3, 1934 is also not divisible by 3.

We continue this process, checking divisibility with increasing prime numbers. 

Dividing 1934 by 5, we get 386 remainder 4.

Dividing 1934 by 7, we get 276 remainder 2.

Since we have checked divisibility with prime numbers up to the square root of 1934 (which is approximately 44), and have found no divisors other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that 1934 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 1934 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we first need to understand what a composite number is. 

A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that is divisible by at least one number other than 1 and itself. 

Now, let's apply this definition to the number 1934. We need to check if 1934 is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

To do that, we can check divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 1934, which is approximately 44.

We start by checking if 1934 is divisible by 2. If we divide 1934 by 2, we get a quotient of 967 with a remainder of 0. This means that 1934 is divisible by 2.

Therefore, 1934 is a composite number because it is divisible by at least one number other than 1 and itself (in this case, 2).

###
Yes, 4837 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 4837 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers up to its square root.

The square root of 4837 is approximately 69.56.

Next, we can check if 4837 is divisible by any prime numbers up to 69. 

Let's check divisibility by small prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, and 7.

4837 is not divisible by 2 since it is an odd number.
The sum of the digits of 4837 is 4 + 8 + 3 + 7 = 22. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, 4837 is not divisible by 3 either.
4837 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
The remainder when dividing 4837 by 7 is 4, so it is not divisible by 7.

Therefore, we can conclude that 4837 is not divisible by any prime numbers up to 69.

Since 4837 is not divisible by any primes up to its square root, we can determine that 4837 is a prime number.

So, yes, 4837 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 4837 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 4837 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

Starting with 2, we can check if it divides evenly into 4837. If not, we move to the next integer, which is 3. We continue this process until we reach the square root of 4837 or find a divisor.

Taking the square root of 4837 gives us approximately 69.56. We don't need to check for divisors beyond this point because any number greater than the square root will have a corresponding divisor smaller than it.

Now, we check if any integers less than or equal to 69 divide evenly into 4837. After trying several values, it is determined that 4837 is not divisible by any numbers less than or equal to 69.

Since we have not found any divisors other than 1 and 4837 itself, we can conclude that 4837 is a prime number, not a composite number.

71: 5314 ÷ 71 = 74.99 (not divisible)
73: 5314 ÷ 73 = 72.85 (not divisible)

After checking prime numbers up to 73, we can conclude that 5314 is not divisible by any of them. Therefore, it does not have any other factors besides 1 and itself.

Therefore, 5314 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 5314 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 5314 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, let's find the factors of 5314 by checking which numbers divide evenly into it.

Starting with 2, we can see that 5314 is not divisible by 2 since its last digit, 4, is not even.

Next, let's try dividing by 3. Adding up the digits of 5314, we get 5 + 3 + 1 + 4 = 13, which is not divisible by 3.

Now, let's try dividing by 5. Since 5314 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Moving on to 7, we can test if 5314 is divisible by 7. Subtracting twice the last digit (2*4 = 8) from the remaining digits (531 - 8 = 523), we determine that 5314 is not divisible by 7.

By continuing this process for larger prime numbers, we can conclude that 5314 is not divisible by any prime numbers up to its square root (√5314 ≈ 72.98).

Therefore, 5314 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself and hence, it is a prime number.

No, 4299 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 4299 is a prime number, we need to test if it is divisible by any number greater than 1 and less than or equal to its square root (rounded down).

First, let's find the square root of 4299. The square root of 4299 is approximately 65.59.

Next, we will check if 4299 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 65.59. 

Starting with 2, we see that 4299 is not divisible by 2 (remainder is not 0).
Moving on to 3, we see that 4299 is not divisible by 3 (remainder is not 0).
Continuing with 5, we see that 4299 is not divisible by 5 (remainder is not 0).
Testing with 7, we find that 4299 is not divisible by 7 (remainder is not 0).
Next, we try 11, and again find that 4299 is not divisible by 11 (remainder is not 0).
Continuing with 13, we find that 4299 is divisible by 13, as 4299 ÷ 13 = 331 with no remainder.

Since we have found a divisor of 4299 (which is 13), we can conclude that 4299 is not a prime number.

Therefore, 4299 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 4299 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 4299 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, let's check divisibility by 2: 
If the last digit of a number is even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), then the number itself is divisible by 2. However, the last digit of 4299 is 9, which is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check divisibility by 3: 
To check divisibility by 3, we add up the individual digits of the number and check if the sum is divisible by 3. In this case, 4 + 2 + 9 + 9 = 24, and 24 is divisible by 3. Therefore, 4299 is divisible by 3.

Since 4299 is divisible by 3, it is a composite number.

It can be expressed as the product of two or more prime numbers: 3 * 1433 = 4299.

###
No, 5906 is not a prime number. It can be divided by 2, 7, 13, and 67.
###
To determine if 5906 is a prime number, we need to check if it can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 5906.

To find the square root of 5906, we can use a calculator or estimate it to be around 76.8 (since 77^2 = 5,929).

Step 2: Check divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root.

Let's check if 5906 is divisible by prime numbers up to 76.8:
- 2: 5906 is even, so it is divisible by 2.
- 3: The sum of the digits in 5906 is 5 + 9 + 0 + 6 = 20. Since 20 is divisible by 3, 5906 is also divisible by 3.

Since 5906 is divisible by both 2 and 3, it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 5906 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

The number 5906 is not divisible by 2, as the last digit is not even.

To check if it is divisible by 3, we add all the digits together: 5 + 9 + 0 + 6 = 20. The sum is not divisible by 3 since 20 is not divisible by 3.

Since it is not divisible by either 2 or 3, it is safe to say that it is not divisible by any smaller prime numbers. Therefore, 5906 could still be a composite number.

To continue, we can check divisibility by other prime numbers such as 5 or 7, or we can attempt to find a factor by using a different method, like prime factorization or using a calculator.
###
Yes.
###
Yes, 5906 is divisible by 2953.
###
No, 7053 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3 and 2351.
###
To determine if a number is prime, we need to check whether it is divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself. 

To check if 7053 is prime, we will perform trial division by dividing it by prime numbers lower than its square root (since larger factors would have corresponding smaller factors). If we find any factor that divides 7053 evenly, then it is not prime.  

Let's check:

- First, we check divisibility by 2. 7053 is not even, so it is not divisible by 2.

- Next, we check divisibility by 3. The sum of the digits of 7053 is 7 + 0 + 5 + 3 = 15, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 7053 is divisible by 3.

Since 7053 is divisible by 3, it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 7053 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to see if it has more than two factors. 

Step 1: We first check if the number is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is composite because it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

Step 2: If the number is not divisible by 2, we check if it is divisible by any odd numbers up to the square root of the number. 

Now let's apply these steps to the number 7053: 

Step 1: 7053 is not divisible by 2 because the last digit is 3, which is not an even number. 

Step 2: To check for divisibility by odd numbers up to the square root of 7053, we calculate the square root of 7053, which is approximately 83.99. 

Now, we check if 7053 is divisible by any odd numbers up to 83. 

7053 ÷ 3 = 2351, remainder 0 

Since 7053 is divisible by 3, it has factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 7053 is a composite number.

The square root of 3639 is approximately 60.32. 

Now let's check the divisibility of 3639 by numbers from 2 to 60. 

It is helpful to know that if a number ends in an odd digit (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), it is not divisible by 2. 

When we divide 3639 by 2, we get a decimal value. This means that 3639 is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check for divisibility by 3. The sum of the digits of 3639 is 3 + 6 + 3 + 9 = 21. Since 21 is divisible by 3, 3639 is also divisible by 3. 

Since 3639 is divisible by 3, it is not a prime number.
###

First, let's find the prime factors of 3639 by dividing it with prime numbers.

Starting with 2, we can see that 3639 is not divisible by 2 since its last digit is odd.

Next, we try 3. If we add up the digits of 3639, we get 3 + 6 + 3 + 9 = 21. Since 21 is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 3639 is divisible by 3.

Dividing 3639 by 3 gives us 1213.

Now, we need to check if 1213 is prime or composite. We can repeat the same process by trying to divide it with prime numbers starting from 2. However, since it requires further calculations, we can assume that 1213 is prime for now.

Therefore, we have found that the prime factorization of 3639 is 3 × 1213.

Since 3639 can be expressed as the product of 3 and a number other than 1 and itself, it is a composite number.

In summary, yes, 3639 is a composite number.

###
Yes, 5277 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 5277 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root (rounded up to the nearest whole number). The square root of 5277 is approximately 72.65, so we only need to check prime numbers up to 72.

Let's start by checking if 5277 is divisible by 2. Since 5277 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 5277 is 5 + 2 + 7 + 7 = 21, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 5277 is divisible by 3.

###
To determine whether 8098 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. One way to do this is by finding its prime factors.

To find the prime factors of 8098, we can start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2:

Let's check:

2: 3207 is not divisible by 2.
3: 3207 is not divisible by 3.
5: 3207 is not divisible by 5.

To further check for divisibility by other numbers, we can calculate the sum of the digits: 
5 + 8 + 5 + 4 = 22

Since 22 is divisible by 11, we can conclude that 5854 is also divisible by 11.

Therefore, 5854 is not a prime number because it is divisible by both 2 and 11.
###
No, 5854 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
###
To determine if 5854 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

First, check if 2 is a divisor of 5854: 5854 ÷ 2 = 2927, remainder 0. So, 2 is a divisor.

Next, check if 3 is a divisor of 5854: 5 + 8 + 5 + 4 = 22. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, 3 is not a divisor.

Then, check if 4 is a divisor of 5854: 5854 ÷ 4 = 1463.5. Since 1463.5 is not a whole number, 4 is not a divisor.

Continue this process until you reach the square root of 5854, which is approximately 76.5.

After checking all the possible divisors up to the square root, we can conclude that 5854 is a composite number because it has divisors other than 1 and itself, such as 2 and 2927.

###
To determine if 3459 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any whole number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If the last digit of 3459 is even, then it is divisible by 2. However, 3459 ends with an odd digit (9), so it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 3459 (3+4+5+9) is 21. If 21 is divisible by 3, then 3459 is also divisible by 3. Since 21 is divisible by 3 (7 x 3 = 21), we can conclude that 3459 is divisible by 3. 

Therefore, 3459 is not a prime number, as it is divisible by 3.
###
Yes, 3459 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 3459 is a composite number, we need to understand what a composite number is. 

A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that is divisible by at least one number other than 1 and itself.

Now, let's check if 3459 is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

The first prime number we can check is 2. When we divide 3459 by 2, we get a decimal quotient, which means 3459 is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check 3. When we divide 3459 by 3, we get a quotient of 1153. 

So, 3459 is divisible by 3.

Therefore, 3459 is a composite number since it is divisible by a number other than 1 and itself.

The first step is to find the square root of 2191, which is approximately 46.84.

Next, we check for divisibility by prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 2191.

Starting with 2, we see that 2191 is not divisible by 2.

Moving on to 3, we find that the sum of its digits (2 + 1 + 9 + 1) is 13, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 2191 is not divisible by 3.

Checking 5, we see that the last digit of 2191 is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Continuing with prime numbers, we check 7, 11, 13... However, we can skip these numbers because they are greater than the square root of 2191.

Therefore, we can conclude that 2191 is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to its square root.

Thus, 2191 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 2191 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 2191 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If the last digit of the number is even (divisible by 2), then the whole number is divisible by 2. However, the last digit of 2191 is 1, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can try dividing it by odd numbers starting from 3. However, trying each odd number would be time-consuming.

Alternatively, we can check if it is divisible by any primes less than or equal to the square root of 2191. The square root of 2191 is approximately 46.8. 

We can test prime numbers less than or equal to 46.8 (such as 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, and 43) to see if any of these divide 2191 evenly.

Checking each of these primes will determine if 2191 is composite or prime.

No, 4791 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 3 and 1597, in addition to other factors.
###
To determine whether 4791 is a prime number, we can initially check for divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 4791. If there is no divisor apart from 1 and itself, then 4791 is prime.

The square root of 4791 is approximately 69.24, so we only need to check divisibility by prime numbers up to 69.

1. Checking divisibility by 2: 4791 is not divisible by 2 because it is an odd number.

2. Checking divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of 4791 is 21, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 4791 is divisible by 3.

Hence, 4791 is not prime.

###
No, 5485 is not a prime number. It can be evenly divided by 5, 17, 19, and 61.
###
To determine if 5485 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we can see if it is divisible by 2. If the last digit of a number is even, then the number itself is divisible by 2. In this case, the last digit of 5485 is 5, which is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we sum up the digits of the number. In this case, 5 + 4 + 8 + 5 = 22. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 5485 is not divisible by 3.

5485 is not divisible by 2 or 3, so we can move on to divide it by numbers greater than 3. However, to simplify the process, we can check for divisibility by prime numbers less than the square root of 5485, which is approximately 74.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 5. If the last digit is 0 or 5, then the number itself is divisible by 5. However, since the last digit of 5485 is 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Lastly, we can check if it is divisible by 7. For this, we need to use a divisibility rule for 7, which states that a number is divisible by 7 if the difference between twice the unit digit and the remaining leading truncated number is divisible by 7.

In this case, the unit digit is 5, so twice that is 10. The truncated number is 548. The difference between them is 10 - 548 = -538. Since -538 is not divisible by 7, we can conclude that 5485 is not divisible by 7.

Therefore, we have checked all the prime numbers less than the square root of 5485 and found that it is not divisible by any of them. Therefore, we can conclude that 5485 is a prime number.
###

Dividing 5485 by 2 gives us 2742.5, which is not an integer.

Dividing 5485 by 3 gives us 1828.33, which is not an integer.

Trying 4, 5, 6, and 7 as potential factors also gives non-integer results.

Now we try dividing 5485 by 8, which yields 685.625, still not an integer.

Dividing 5485 by 9 gives us 609.44, not an integer.

Continuing this process, we find that 5485 is not evenly divisible by any primes up to its square root, which is approximately 74.1.

Since no factors other than 1 and 5485 are found, we can conclude that 5485 is a prime number and not a composite number.

###
No, 7862 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2, 3929, 523 and 17.
###
To determine whether 7862 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Find the square root of 7862. 
√7862 ≈ 88.603

Step 2: Check for divisors. 
Starting from the smallest prime number (2) and going up to the square root of 7862 (approximately 89), we can check if any of these numbers divide evenly into 7862.

After trying a few numbers, we find that 7862 is divisible by 2, as 7862 ÷ 2 = 3931.

Therefore, 7862 is not a prime number since it has divisors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 7862 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 7862 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, let's find the prime factors of 7862:

To find the prime factors, we can start by dividing 7862 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

7862 ÷ 2 = 3931

3931 is not divisible by 2, so let's try the next prime number, which is 3.

3931 ÷ 3 = 1310.3333333

Since 1310.3333 is not a whole number, 3 is not a factor of 7862. 

Let's try 5 as the next prime number:

7862 ÷ 5 = 1572.4

Again, 1572.4 is not a whole number, so 5 is not a factor of 7862.

Now, let's try 7 as the next prime number:

7862 ÷ 7 = 1123.142

Once again, 1123.142 is not a whole number, so 7 is also not a factor of 7862.

Finally, let's try 11 as the next prime number:

7862 ÷ 11 = 715.6363636

715.6363636 is not a whole number either, so 11 is not a factor of 7862.

As we have tested all prime numbers up to 11, and none of them are factors of 7862, we can conclude that 7862 is a composite number since it has factors other than 1 and itself.
