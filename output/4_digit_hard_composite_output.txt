###
Yes.
###
Yes.
###
No, 7171 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 17 and 421.
###
To determine if 7171 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we check divisibility by 2. Since 7171 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check divisibility by 3. To do this, we sum up the digits of 7171: 7 + 1 + 7 + 1 = 16. Since 16 is not divisible by 3, 7171 is also not divisible by 3.

We can continue this process for other prime numbers, but instead, we can check for divisibility up to the square root of 7171, as larger factors must be paired with smaller factors. The square root of 7171 is approximately 84.7.

Checking divisibility by 5, we observe that 7171 does not end with a 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Continuing this process, we can check divisibility by primes up to 84, but we find that none divide evenly into 7171.

Therefore, we can deduce that 7171 is a prime number, as it is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
###
No, 7171 is not a composite number. It is a prime number because it only has two distinct positive divisors: 1 and 7171.
###
To determine if 7171 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by finding the square root of 7171, which is approximately 84.7. We only need to check for factors up to this square root value.

Next, we can check if 7171 is divisible by any prime numbers up to 84.7. 

Starting with 2, we find that 7171 is not divisible by 2. 

Moving on to 3, we find that the sum of the digits of 7171 is 16, which is not divisible by 3. 

Continuing with 5, we find that 7171 is not divisible by 5. 

Next, we check 7 as a potential factor. The sum of the digits of 7171 is 16, which is not divisible by 7.

We can continue checking prime numbers up to the square root of 7171. However, it is evident from the previous checks that 7171 is not divisible by any prime numbers up to 7.

Therefore, as we have not found any factors other than 1 and 7171 itself, we can conclude that 7171 is a prime number and not a composite number.
###

###
Yes.
###
Yes, 8201 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 8201 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root. 

Let's find the square root of 8201: 

√8201 ≈ 90.467 

Now we will check if 8201 is divisible by any prime numbers less than 90. 

Starting from 2, we check if 8201 is divisible by 2. 

8201 ÷ 2 = 4100.5 

Since the result is not an integer, 8201 is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we check if 8201 is divisible by 3. 

8201 ÷ 3 ≈ 2733.667 

Again, the result is not an integer, so 8201 is not divisible by 3. 

We continue this process and check for divisibility by prime numbers up to approximately 90. 

After checking all the prime numbers, we find that 8201 is not divisible by any of them. 

Therefore, we can conclude that 8201 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 8201 is a composite number.

###
Yes, 6667 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 6667 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Start by checking divisibility by 2. Since 6667 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Step 2: Next, we check divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 6667, which is approximately 81.7.

Step 3: We begin dividing 6667 by prime numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79), but none of them give a whole number result.

Since none of the prime numbers up to the square root of 6667 divide it evenly, we can conclude that 6667 is a prime number.

So, yes, 6667 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 6667 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 6667 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can divide 6667 by all the numbers less than its square root (approximately 81.6). If we find any whole number results, then 6667 would have factors other than 1 and itself. 

Let's do the calculations: 

6667 ÷ 2 = 3333.5
6667 ÷ 3 = 2222.33
6667 ÷ 4 = 1666.75
...
6667 ÷ 80 = 83.3375

Since we did not find any whole number results when dividing 6667 by numbers less than its square root, we can conclude that it has no factors other than 1 and itself. 

Therefore, 6667 is not a composite number; it is a prime number.

###
Yes, 3599 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 3599 is a prime number, we can use the process of trial division. 

First, we check if 3599 is divisible by 2. Since 3599 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can move on.

Next, we check if 3599 is divisible by any odd numbers up to the square root of 3599 (rounded down). The square root of 3599 is approximately 59.99 (rounded down to 59). So, we need to check if 3599 is divisible by any odd numbers from 3 to 59.

We start with 3 and try dividing 3599 by 3. The result is not a whole number.

Next, we try dividing 3599 by 5. Again, the result is not a whole number.

We continue this process for the remaining odd numbers up to 59, and we find that none of them divide 3599 evenly.

Therefore, we can conclude that 3599 is a prime number, as it is only divisible by 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 3599 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To find the factors of 3599, we can start by dividing it by smaller numbers. However, we don't need to check numbers greater than the square root of 3599.

The square root of 3599 is approximately 59.99. 

We can now check if 3599 is divisible by any numbers between 2 and 59. If we find a factor, then 3599 is composite. If no factors are found, then 3599 is prime.

After checking, we find that 3599 is not divisible by any numbers between 2 and 59. Thus, 3599 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 3599 is a prime number and not a composite number.
###

###
Yes, 3599 is divisible by 61.
###
No, 6161 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 6161 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2.
6161 is not divisible by 2 because it does not end in an even number.

Step 2: Check divisibility by odd numbers from 3 to the square root of 6161.
Proceeding with the division may take some time, but we can use a calculator or computer program to simplify the process. 

Upon checking, we find that 6161 is not divisible by any odd numbers up to its square root, which is approximately 78.54.

Therefore, 6161 is a prime number, as it is only divisible by 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 6161 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to check if the number has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can start by finding the prime factors of the number. We can do this by checking divisibility by prime numbers starting from 2.

Let's try dividing 6161 by 2. Since 6161 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we try dividing by 3. When we divide 6161 by 3, we get a quotient of 2053 with a remainder of 2. Therefore, 3 is not a factor of 6161.

We continue checking divisibility by prime numbers. We can skip 5 since 6161 does not end in 0 or 5.

Next, we try dividing by 7. When we divide 6161 by 7, we get a quotient of 880 with a remainder of 1. Therefore, 7 is not a factor of 6161.

We can continue checking divisibility by other primes, but it can be a lengthy process. Another approach is to use the square root of the number. 

The square root of 6161 is approximately 78.49. We only need to check divisibility by prime numbers less than or equal to 78.

By checking these prime numbers, we can find that 6161 has no factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 6161 is a prime number, not a composite number.

21. Divide 5671 by 73: 5671 ÷ 73 = 77.5342 (not an integer)

Since there were no whole number results from the divisions, we can conclude that 5671 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

Therefore, we can say that 5671 is a prime number and not a composite number.

No.
###
Yes.
###
No, 9263 is not a prime number. It has divisors other than 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 9263 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

We can start by checking its divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 9263.

The square root of 9263 is approximately 96.09. So, we need to check the divisibility of 9263 by prime numbers up to 96.

We can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 9263 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check if it is divisible by 3. By summing the digits of 9263 (9 + 2 + 6 + 3 = 20), we can see that it is not divisible by 3.

Continuing with this process, we can check divisibility by 5, 7, 11, and so on until 96.

If we find any factor of 9263, then it is not a prime number. Otherwise, it is a prime number.

Please let me know if you would like me to continue checking for divisibility.
###

###
Yes, 7729 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 7729 is a prime number, we can use the process of trial division. 

We start by checking if 7729 is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root. The square root of 7729 is approximately 87.93.

We'll check divisibility by primes less than or equal to 87. We divide 7729 by 2, but it does not evenly divide. Then we divide by 3, but again, there is a remainder. Continuing this process, we check divisibility by 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, and 87.

After checking all these prime numbers, we find that none of them divide 7729 evenly. Thus, 7729 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. 

Therefore, we can conclude that 7729 is indeed a prime number.
###
Yes, 7729 is a composite number. It is divisible by 7 and 1104, apart from being divisible by 1 and itself.
###
To determine whether 7729 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To find the factors of 7729, we can divide it by numbers starting from 2 up to the square root of 7729. 

First, we check if 2 is a factor of 7729. We divide 7729 by 2:

7729 ÷ 2 = 3864.5

Since the result is not a whole number, 2 is not a factor of 7729. 

Next, we check if 3 is a factor of 7729. We divide 7729 by 3:

7729 ÷ 3 = 2576.333...

Again, the result is not a whole number, so 3 is not a factor. 

Continuing this process, we check for factors up to the square root of 7729 (which is approximately 88). 

By checking all possible factors, we can conclude that 7729 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

Therefore, 7729 is not a composite number—it is a prime number.
###
No.
###
Yes
###
Yes, 4661 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 4661 is a prime number, we can use some basic principles of number theory. 

First, we can check if any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 4661 divide evenly into it. If any prime numbers do, then 4661 is not a prime number. 

The square root of 4661 is approximately 68.271. We can check if any prime numbers less than or equal to 68 divide evenly into 4661. 

Checking divisibility of 4661 by prime numbers less than or equal to 68:

2 does not divide 4661. 
3 does not divide 4661.
5 does not divide 4661.
7 does not divide 4661.
11 does not divide 4661.
13 does not divide 4661.
...and so on until 67 (the largest prime number less than or equal to 68).

Therefore, 4661 does not have any prime factors less than or equal to its square root, which suggests that it may be a prime number. However, we need to perform further checks to confirm.

Next, we can check if any odd numbers greater than 68 divide evenly into 4661. If any odd numbers do, then 4661 is not a prime number. 

Let's check divisibility of 4661 by odd numbers greater than 68:

69 does not divide 4661.
71 does not divide 4661.
...and so on.

Since none of the odd numbers greater than 68 divides evenly into 4661, we have checked all possible factors. Therefore, 4661 is a prime number.

In conclusion, 4661 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 4661 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 4661 is a composite number, we need to check if it can be divided evenly by any number other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we start by finding the square root of 4661. The square root of 4661 is approximately 68.24.

Next, we check if 4661 is divisible by any number from 2 to 68 (excluding 1 and 4661 itself). If we find any factor, then 4661 is a composite number.

After checking all the numbers from 2 to 68, we find that 4661 cannot be divided evenly by any of these numbers. Therefore, we conclude that 4661 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Hence, 4661 is not a composite number, but a prime number.
###
Yes, 4661 is divisible by 59.
###
Yes
###
No, 3127 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 7 and 13.
###
To determine if 3127 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

We can begin by checking if 3127 is divisible by 2. Since the last digit of 3127 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check divisibility by odd numbers up to the square root of 3127. The square root of 3127 is approximately 55.92.

We start by checking if 3127 is divisible by 3, but the sum of its digits (3 + 1 + 2 + 7 = 13) is not divisible by 3, so 3127 is not divisible by 3.

We continue checking divisibility by other odd numbers up to 55.92, but we find that 3127 is not divisible by any of them.

Thus, we conclude that 3127 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 3127 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 3127 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if 3127 is divisible by 2. However, since it is an odd number and does not end in an even digit, it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can try dividing 3127 by prime numbers up to its square root (√3127 ≈ 55.96). 

We try dividing 3127 by 3: 3127 ÷ 3 = 1042.33 (not divisible).

We try dividing 3127 by 5: 3127 ÷ 5 = 625.40 (not divisible).

We try dividing 3127 by 7: 3127 ÷ 7 = 446.71 (not divisible).

We try dividing 3127 by 11: 3127 ÷ 11 = 284.27 (not divisible).

Continuing this process, we find that there are no prime numbers up to √3127 that divide 3127 evenly.

Therefore, we can conclude that 3127 is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. Hence, 3127 is a prime number, not a composite number.
###
Yes, 3127 is divisible by 53.
###
Yes
###
No, 9271 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 9271 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers up to its square root.

The square root of 9271 is approximately 96.26. We can check if 9271 is divisible by prime numbers up to 96.

First, we can check divisibility by 2. Since 9271 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check divisibility by 3. The sum of the digits of 9271 (9 + 2 + 7 + 1) is 19. Since 19 is not divisible by 3, 9271 is also not divisible by 3.

Moving on to checking divisibility by 5. Since 9271 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

We can continue checking divisibility by prime numbers up to 96, but we find that 9271 is not divisible by any of them.

Therefore, we can conclude that 9271 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 9271 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 9271 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can perform a factorization test by dividing 9271 by prime numbers starting from 2. 

We find that when dividing 9271 by 2, there is no remainder. Hence, 2 is a factor of 9271.

9271 ÷ 2 = 4635.5

Since 2 is a factor, we continue dividing 9271 by the next prime number, which is 3.

Again, when dividing 9271 by 3, there is no remainder. Hence, 3 is also a factor of 9271.

9271 ÷ 3 = 3090.333...

We can see that the quotient is not an integer, so 3 is not a factor of 9271.

Therefore, the factors of 9271 are 1 and 9271 itself. Since there are no other factors, 9271 is not divisible by any other numbers, and it does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Based on this, we can conclude that 9271 is a prime number, not a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes.
###
No, 8249 is not a prime number. It is a composite number.
###
To determine if 8249 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Let's check by dividing 8249 by numbers from 2 to the square root of 8249, which is approximately 90.9.

When we divide 8249 by 2, we get a remainder of 1.
When we divide 8249 by 3, we get a remainder of 1.
When we divide 8249 by 4, we get a remainder of 1.
When we divide 8249 by 5, we get a remainder of 4.
When we divide 8249 by 6, we get a remainder of 5.
When we divide 8249 by 7, we get a remainder of 5.
When we divide 8249 by 8, we get a remainder of 1.
When we divide 8249 by 9, we get a remainder of 7.
When we divide 8249 by 10, we get a remainder of 9.
When we divide 8249 by 11, we get a remainder of 5.
When we divide 8249 by 12, we get a remainder of 1.
When we divide 8249 by 13, we get a remainder of 0.

Since 8249 is divisible by 13, it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 8249 is a composite number. It can be expressed as the product of two prime numbers: 59 and 139.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

To check if 8249 is divisible by a number, we need to divide it by numbers starting from 2 and going up to the square root of 8249 (approximately 90.88). 

So, let's start dividing 8249 by 2:
8249 ÷ 2 = 4124.5

Since the result is not a whole number, we move on to the next number, 3:
8249 ÷ 3 = 2749.666...

Again, the result is not a whole number. We continue with numbers 4, 5, 6, and so on.

But we reach a point where no numbers are able to divide 8249 evenly without any remainder. This means that 8249 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, we can conclude that 8249 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes.
###
Yes, 7739 is a prime number.
###
First, we need to check if 7739 is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of 7739 (rounded up). 

The square root of 7739 is approximately 87.99. So, we need to check if 7739 is divisible by any number between 2 and 88 (inclusive).

Now, let's check division by numbers from 2 to 88:

7739 ÷ 2 = 3869.5 (not divisible)
7739 ÷ 3 = 2579.67 (not divisible)
7739 ÷ 4 = 1934.75 (not divisible)
...
7739 ÷ 87 = 89.29 (not divisible)
7739 ÷ 88 = 88.08 (not divisible)

Since we did not find any whole number divisor for 7739 between 2 and 88, we can conclude that 7739 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 7739 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 7739 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by finding the square root of 7739, which is approximately 88.05. Now, let's check if there are any whole numbers between 2 and 88 that divide evenly into 7739.

By testing all numbers from 2 to 88, we find that none of them divide evenly into 7739. Therefore, 7739 is a prime number and not a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes
###
Yes, 5183 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 5183 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if 2 is a factor of 5183. We do this by dividing 5183 by 2, and if the result is a whole number, then 2 is a factor. 

5183 ÷ 2 = 2591.5 

Since the result is not a whole number, 2 is not a factor of 5183. 

Next, we can check for other possible factors by dividing 5183 by odd numbers starting from 3, 5, 7, and so on, until the square root of 5183 is reached or a factor is found.

We calculate the square root of 5183:

√5183 ≈ 71.99

We only need to check for factors up to 71 because any factor greater than this would have a corresponding factor less than the square root of 5183.

Now, we proceed to check if 3 is a factor:

5183 ÷ 3 = 1727.67

Since the result is not a whole number, 3 is not a factor.

We continue this process with other odd numbers less than or equal to 71.

We find that 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67 do not divide evenly into 5183.

Finally, we try dividing 5183 by 71:

5183 ÷ 71 = 73

Since the result is a whole number, 71 is a factor of 5183.

Therefore, 5183 is not a prime number as it has factors other than 1 and itself (71 and 73).
###
Yes, 5183 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 5183 is a composite number, we need to consider its factors. 

First, we can check if 5183 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 5183. The square root of 5183 is approximately 71.99.

Let's test the divisibility of 5183 by prime numbers up to 71. We start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.

When we divide 5183 by 2, we get a remainder of 1.

Next, let's try dividing by 3. When we divide 5183 by 3, we get a remainder of 1.

We continue trying to divide by prime numbers up to 71 and find that none of them divide 5183 perfectly without any remainder.

Since no prime numbers can divide 5183 exactly, we conclude that 5183 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes
###
No, 7747 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 7 and 1107.
###
To determine if 7747 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can start by finding the square root of 7747.

√7747 ≈ 88

Next, we need to check if 7747 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 88.

If we divide 7747 by 2, we get a remainder of 1.
If we divide 7747 by 3, we get a remainder of 2.
If we divide 7747 by 5, we get a remainder of 2.
If we divide 7747 by 7, we get a remainder of 3.
If we divide 7747 by 11, we get a remainder of 10.
If we divide 7747 by 13, we get a remainder of 5.
If we divide 7747 by 17, we get a remainder of 0.

Since 7747 is divisible by 17 without any remainder, it means that 7747 is not a prime number. It has factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 7747 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 7747 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 7747 is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we find the square root of 7747:
√7747 ≈ 87.998

Next, we check for any factors between 2 and 87.998:
7747 ÷ 2 = 3873.5 (not a whole number)
7747 ÷ 3 = 2582.33 (not a whole number)
...
7747 ÷ 87 ≈ 89.183 (not a whole number)

Since 7747 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself (as all divisions resulted in non-whole numbers), it is not a composite number. It is classified as a prime number.
###
Yes
###
Yes.
###
No, 9797 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 17 and 577, in addition to 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 9797 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

First, we find the square root of 9797. The square root of 9797 is approximately 98.98.

Next, we check if 9797 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 98.98. 

We start with 2, but 9797 is not divisible by 2 since it is an odd number.

Then, we move to the next prime number, 3. By summing up the digits of 9797, we get 9+7+9+7 = 32. Since 32 is divisible by 3 (9+7+9+7 = 32, and 3+2 = 5, which is divisible by 3), we conclude that 9797 is divisible by 3.

Therefore, 9797 is not a prime number, as it is divisible by 3.
###
Yes, 9797 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 9797 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. If it ends with an even digit, then it is divisible by 2. However, 9797 ends with an odd digit (7), so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To determine this, we can add up all the digits of 9797 and then check if the sum is divisible by 3. 

9 + 7 + 9 + 7 = 32

Since 32 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 9797 is also not divisible by 3.

We can also check if it is divisible by 5. If it ends with a 5 or 0, then it is divisible by 5. However, 9797 does not end with either of these digits, so it is not divisible by 5.

Finally, we can check if it is divisible by 7. This method involves doubling the last digit (7) and subtracting it from the remaining digits of the number. If the difference is divisible by 7, then the number is divisible by 7.

979 - (2 * 7) = 979 - 14 = 965

Since 965 is not divisible by 7, we can conclude that 9797 is not divisible by 7 either.

By checking divisibility with the prime numbers up to the square root of 9797 (which is approximately 98), we can determine that 9797 is not divisible by any other numbers, making it a prime number, not a composite number.
###
Yes, 9797 is divisible by 97.
###
Yes.
###
No, 8777 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 7 and 1253, in addition to 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 8777 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if 8777 is divisible by 2. If a number is even and not equal to 2, it is not prime. However, 8777 is an odd number and not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if 8777 is divisible by 3. To do this, we can add up its digits: 8 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 29. Since 29 is not divisible by 3, neither is 8777.

We can continue this process with other prime numbers, but it would be more efficient to use a prime factorization calculator, as 8777 is a relatively large number.

Using a prime factorization calculator, we can determine that 8777 is divisible by 53. 

Therefore, 8777 is not a prime number since it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
No, 8777 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
###
To determine if 8777 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by finding the square root of 8777:

√8777 ≈ 93.64

Next, we check if 8777 is divisible by any whole number between 2 and 93 (inclusive).

If we try dividing by 2, it does not divide evenly:

8777 ÷ 2 = 4388.5

Similarly, dividing by any other whole number does not result in an even division.

Since there are no factors of 8777 other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that 8777 is a prime number, not a composite number.
###
No.
###
Yes, 8777 is divisible by 131.
###
Yes, 6731 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 6731 is a prime number, let's check for its divisors. We only need to test divisibility up to the square root of 6731, which is approximately 82.

Starting with 2, we see that 6731 is not divisible by 2 because it is an odd number.

We then move on to the next prime number, which is 3. By adding up the digits of 6731 (6 + 7 + 3 + 1 = 17), we can see that 6731 is not divisible by 3 because the sum is not divisible by 3.

Now, we continue checking divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 6731.

Testing for divisibility by 5, we observe that 6731 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Moving on to the next prime number, 7, we observe that 6731 is not divisible by 7 because the division does not result in a whole number.

Continuing the process, we test divisibility by prime numbers 11 and 13, but neither of them divide 6731 without a remainder.

Since we have tested all prime numbers less than the square root of 6731 and found no divisors, we can conclude that 6731 is a prime number.

Therefore, 6731 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 6731 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to check if it has any factors besides 1 and itself.

To begin, let's find the factors of 6731 by checking all numbers smaller than the square root of 6731.

The square root of 6731 is approximately 82.013.

Starting with 2, we check if it divides evenly into 6731. If it does, then 2 is a factor of 6731 and we can conclude that 6731 is a composite number.

However, after checking all numbers from 2 up to 82, we find that none of them divide evenly into 6731. This indicates that there are no factors other than 1 and 6731.

Therefore, 6731 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, making it a prime number.

In conclusion, 6731 is a prime number and not a composite number.
###
Yes, 6731 is divisible by 53.
###
Yes, 6731 is divisible by 127.
###
Yes, 9301 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 9301 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can check divisibility up to the square root of 9301.

The square root of 9301 is approximately 96.48 (rounded to two decimal places).

Now, let's check if 9301 is divisible by any number up to 96.

Starting from 2, we find that 9301 divided by 2 is not a whole number.

We continue checking divisibility up to 96 and find that 9301 is not divisible by any number.

Therefore, we can conclude that 9301 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 9301 is a prime number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. We can start by finding the factors of 9301:

1 x 9301 = 9301
23 x 404 = 9301

Since 9301 has factors other than 1 and itself (23 and 404), it is a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes.
###
Yes, 8791 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 8791 is a prime number, we can apply the divisibility test and check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

We start by finding the square root of 8791, which is approximately 93.73 (rounded up to two decimal places).

Then, we check for divisibility by prime numbers up to 93:

1. 8791 is not divisible by 2 (it does not end with an even number).
2. 8791 is not divisible by 3 (the sum of its digits is not a multiple of 3: 8 + 7 + 9 + 1 = 25).
3. 8791 is not divisible by 5 (it does not end with 0 or 5).
4. 8791 is not divisible by 7 (the alternating sum of its digits is not a multiple of 7: 8 - 7 + 9 - 1 = 9).
5. 8791 is not divisible by 11 (the difference between the sum of the odd and even-placed digits is not a multiple of 11: (8 + 9) - (7 + 1) = 9).
6. 8791 is not divisible by 13 (the alternating sum of its digits from right to left is not a multiple of 13: (1 - 9 + 7 - 8) = -9).

Since we have checked all prime numbers up to the square root of 8791 and found no divisors, we can conclude that 8791 is indeed a prime number.
###
Yes, 8791 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 
To find factors, we need to check all numbers that divide evenly into 8791. 
Since 8791 is a prime number, it only has two factors, which are 1 and 8791. 
Therefore, 8791 is not a composite number.
###

###
Yes.
###
No, 4187 is not a prime number. It can be evenly divided by 23 and 29.
###
To determine if 4187 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can start by checking if 4187 is divisible by prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 4187.

The square root of 4187 is approximately 64.72, so we can check divisibility by prime numbers up to 64.

Let's go through the prime numbers less than or equal to 64:

2: 4187 is not divisible by 2
3: 4187 is not divisible by 3
5: 4187 is not divisible by 5
7: 4187 is not divisible by 7
11: 4187 is not divisible by 11
...
61: 4187 is not divisible by 61
63 is not a prime number, so we don't need to consider it.

We have checked all prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 4187 and found that none of them divide 4187.

Therefore, we can conclude that 4187 is a prime number since it is not divisible by any prime number other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 4187 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether 4187 is a composite number, we need to check if it can be divided evenly by any number other than 1 and itself.

We can do this by attempting to divide 4187 by prime numbers:

Let's start by dividing 4187 by 2. If 4187 is divisible by 2, then it's not a prime number. However, 4187 is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's try dividing by 3. Again, 4187 is not divisible by 3.

We can try dividing by 5. However, 4187 is not divisible by 5 either.

Continuing in the same manner, we can try dividing by 7, 11, 13, and so on, until we reach the square root of 4187.

If we still find no number that divides 4187 evenly, then 4187 is a prime number. 

After checking all the possible divisors, we find that 4187 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, we can conclude that 4187 is a prime number and not a composite number.
###
Yes. 4187 is divisible by 53.
###
Yes.
###
Yes, 5723 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 5723 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 5723 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To check for divisibility by 3, we can add up the digits: 5 + 7 + 2 + 3 = 17. Since 17 is not divisible by 3, 5723 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue this process for larger numbers, but a more efficient approach is to check divisibility up to the square root of 5723. In this case, the square root is approximately 75.7. So we only need to check divisibility up to 75.

By checking divisibility for all numbers from 4 to 75, we find that 5723 is not divisible by any of them. Therefore, we can conclude that 5723 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 5723 is a composite number. It can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 and itself.
###
To determine whether 5723 is a composite number, we need to check if it can be evenly divided by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

We start by checking all the numbers less than the square root of 5723. The square root of 5723 is approximately 75.68. We try dividing 5723 by each number from 2 to 75.

Upon checking, we find that 5723 cannot be divided evenly by any of these numbers. This means that it has no factors other than 1 and itself. Hence, we conclude that 5723 is a prime number, not a composite number.

###
Yes, 7261 is a composite number. It is divisible by other numbers besides 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 7261 is a composite number, we need to check if it's divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

First, we check divisibility by 2. Since 7261 is an odd number (ends with 1), it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check divisibility by 3. The sum of its digits, 7 + 2 + 6 + 1 = 16, is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 7261 is not divisible by 3.

We continue to check divisibility by higher prime numbers like 5, 7, 11, etc., but 7261 is not divisible by any of them.

###
Yes, 4189 is a prime number.
###
To check if 4189 is a prime number, we need to determine if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 4189 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. 

Then, we check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we can sum the digits of the number and check if the result is divisible by 3. In this case, the sum of the digits is 4 + 1 + 8 + 9 = 22, which is not divisible by 3.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any prime numbers up to the square root of 4189. The square root of 4189 is approximately 64.75, so we only need to check the prime numbers up to 64 in this case.

We can check if 4189 is divisible by 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, and 61. If it is divisible by any of these numbers, then 4189 is not a prime number.

After checking all these prime numbers, we can conclude that 4189 is indeed a prime number since it is not divisible by any of them.

Therefore, 4189 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 4189 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 4189 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if 4189 is divisible by 2. Taking the last digit of 4189, which is 9, we can see that 9 is not divisible by 2. Therefore, 4189 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if 4189 is divisible by 3. By summing up the digits of 4189 (4 + 1 + 8 + 9 = 22), we can see that 22 is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 4189 is not divisible by 3.

Since we have checked divisibility by 2 and 3, we can conclude that 4189 is not divisible by any numbers less than its square root. Therefore, it is unlikely to have any other factors.

###
To determine if 9313 is a prime number, we can follow a step-by-step process.

1. Firstly, we can check if the number is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is not a prime number because prime numbers are only divisible by 1 and themselves, not by any other number.
  
2. Secondly, we can check if the number is divisible by any odd numbers from 3 up to the square root of the number. If any of these values divide evenly into the number, then it is not a prime number.
  
Let's apply these steps to 9313:

1. 9313 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.
  
2. Now, we need to check if 9313 is divisible by any odd numbers up to its square root (which is approximated to be around 96.40). 

   Starting with 3, we find that 9313 is not divisible by 3.
   Continuing, 9313 is not divisible by 5.
   Further, 9313 is not divisible by 7.
   And, 9313 is not divisible by 11.
   Continuing this process, we check all the odd numbers up to the square root of 9313, but none of them divide evenly into 9313.

Since no factors are found up to the square root of 9313, we can conclude that 9313 is a prime number.

Therefore, 9313 is a prime number.

###
Yes, 4717 is a prime number. It is only divisible by 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 4717 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

First, let's check if it is divisible by 2. Since 4717 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check if it is divisible by any odd numbers up to the square root of 4717 (approximately 68). We don't need to check any numbers above this limit since any factors above the square root would have a corresponding factor below the square root.

By checking divisibility for the odd numbers up to 68, we find that 4717 is not divisible by any of them.

Therefore, we can conclude that 4717 is a prime number since it is only divisible by 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 4717 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 4717 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.
Starting with 2, we can try dividing 4717 by consecutive integers to see if any divisions are exact.

When we divide 4717 by 2, we get 2358.5, which is not an integer.

When we divide 4717 by 3, we get 1572.333..., which is not an integer.

When we divide 4717 by 4, we get 1179.25, which is not an integer.

This process continues until we reach 4717. However, we haven't found any exact divisions, which implies that 4717 is not divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 4717 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself, making it a prime number rather than a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes.
###
No, 6767 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 53 and 127.
###
To determine if 6767 is a prime number, we can use a basic prime number checking method. 

First, we need to find the square root of 6767, which is approximately 82.27. 

Next, we can check if any prime numbers less than or equal to 82 can divide 6767. 

Starting from 2, we test if it divides evenly into 6767. However, 2 is not a divisor of 6767 as the last digit is odd and the sum of the digits is not divisible by 3. 

We continue checking divisibility by prime numbers up to 82 (i.e., 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, and 73).

None of these prime numbers divide 6767, so we can conclude that 6767 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 6767 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 6767 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we check if any numbers from 2 to the square root of 6767 divide evenly into it. 

The square root of 6767 is approximately 82.28, so we can check numbers up to 82. 

By testing, we can see that 6767 is divisible by 67, as 6767 divided by 67 gives a quotient of 101. 

Therefore, 6767 is a composite number, since it has factors other than 1 and itself (67 and 101).

No.
###
Yes, 9853 is a prime number.
###
To determine whether 9853 is a prime number, we can follow a step-by-step process.

Step 1: Find the square root of the number.
The square root of 9853 is approximately 99.26.

Step 2: Test for divisibility by prime numbers.
We check if 9853 is divisible by prime numbers up to the square root, which means checking divisibility up to 99.

9853 is not divisible by 2 because it is an odd number.
9853 is not divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits (9 + 8 + 5 + 3) is not divisible by 3.
9853 is not divisible by 5 because it does not end in 0 or 5.
9853 is not divisible by 7 since we need to perform further calculations to check it.
9853 is not divisible by 11 since we need to perform further calculations to check it.
9853 is not divisible by 13 since we need to perform further calculations to check it.

Step 3: Check for divisibility by remaining numbers.
To check for divisibility by 7, 11, and 13, we would need to perform further calculations, such as long division, and verify if there is a whole number quotient. However, since 9853 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13, there is no need to perform these calculations.

Step 4: Determine if 9853 is a prime number.
Since we have checked divisibility up to its square root and 9853 is not divisible by any prime numbers within that range, we can conclude that 9853 is a prime number.

Therefore, 9853 is indeed a prime number.
###
Yes, 9853 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 9853 is a composite number, we need to identify if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

We start by checking if it is divisible by 2. 9853 is not even, since the last digit is not 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. Therefore, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check if it is divisible by any odd number up to its square root, which is approximately 99.26. We find that it is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, or any other odd number up to 99. 

Thus, since we have checked all the numbers up to 99, we can conclude that 9853 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 9853 is a prime number, not a composite number.
###

###
Yes
###
No, 8321 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 8321 is a prime number, we can check for its divisibility by all prime numbers less than its square root.

First, we find the square root of 8321: 

√8321 ≈ 91.21

Next, we check if 8321 is divisible by any prime numbers from 2 to 91.

By testing divisibility, we find that 8321 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89.

Since 8321 has not been found divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root, we can conclude that 8321 is a prime number.
###
No, 8321 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
###
To determine if 8321 is a composite number, we should first understand that a composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that is not a prime number. 

To determine if a number is prime, we would need to check if it is divisible by any integer from 2 to the square root of the number. However, for larger numbers like 8321, checking all the divisors can be time-consuming.

One shortcut is to check if the number is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of the number. If it is not divisible by any prime number, then it is also not divisible by composite numbers.

Using this shortcut, we can check if 8321 is divisible by any prime numbers from 2 to the square root of 8321 (approximately 91).

By testing these prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89), we find that none of them divide 8321 evenly.

Therefore, since 8321 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to its square root, it is not divisible by any other positive integer, making it a prime number.

So, 8321 is not a composite number.

###
Yes, 5251 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 5251 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. Since 5251 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can move on to the next potential factor, which is 3.

To check if 5251 is divisible by 3, we can add up its digits and see if the sum is divisible by 3. In this case, 5 + 2 + 5 + 1 = 13, which is not divisible by 3.

Moving on to the next potential factor, which is 5. Since the number ends in 1, it is not divisible by 5.

Continuing this process, we can skip potential factors of 7 and 11 since 5251 is not larger than their square roots.

Finally, we can check if 5251 is divisible by 13. By performing the division, we find that 5251 is not divisible by 13.

Therefore, after checking the potential factors, we can conclude that 5251 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 5251 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 5251 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

We can do this by finding the prime factorization of 5251. We start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2, but it doesn't divide evenly. 

Next, we try dividing by 3, but 5251 is not divisible by 3 either. 

Then, we try dividing by 5. Dividing 5251 by 5 yields a quotient with a fraction, so 5 is not a factor of 5251.

After testing 2, 3, and 5, we can conclude that 5251 is not divisible by any of these prime numbers. Therefore, 5251 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Hence, we can say that 5251 is a prime number, not a composite number.

To determine if 5767 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number and does not end in 0, 2 does not divide 5767.

Next, we can check divisibility by 3. By adding up the digits of 5767 (5 + 7 + 6 + 7 = 25), we can see that 3 does not divide it.

We can continue this process for larger prime numbers, but since 5767 is a relatively large number, we can stop here.

Therefore, 5767 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 5767 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 5767 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

We can start by checking if 5767 is divisible by 2. If the last digit of 5767 is even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), then 5767 is divisible by 2. However, since the last digit of 5767 is 7, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if 5767 is divisible by 3. To do this, we can add up all the digits of 5767 and check if the resulting sum is divisible by 3. 
5 + 7 + 6 + 7 = 25

Since 25 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 5767 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue this process for other prime numbers, but a more efficient approach is to use the divisibility test for prime numbers up to the square root of 5767.

To check divisibility by 5, we only need to check if the last digit is 0 or 5. In this case, the last digit is 7, so 5767 is not divisible by 5.

By checking divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 5767 (which is approximately 75.97), we can conclude that 5767 is not divisible by any prime numbers. Therefore, we can say that 5767 is a prime number.

###
To determine if 5777 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking all the numbers up to the square root of 5777 since any factors larger than the square root will have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root. 

The square root of 5777 is approximately 76.03, so we can check all the numbers up to 76.

We divide 5777 by each number starting from 2 up to 76 to see if there is any whole number division. If we find any such division, then 5777 is not a prime number.

We can see that none of the numbers from 2 to 76 divide 5777 evenly. So, there is no whole number division, and 5777 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 5777 is a prime number.
###

###
To determine if 5777 is a composite number, we need to find if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can check if any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 5777 are factors of 5777.

Let's find the prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 5777:
√5777 ≈ 76.01

The prime numbers less than or equal to 76 are:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, and 73.

Now we need to check if any of these prime numbers are factors of 5777.

Yes, 7313 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 7313 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

The first step is to find the square root of 7313. The square root of 7313 is approximately 85.51 (rounded to two decimal places). 

Now, we need to check if any prime numbers up to 85.51 divide 7313 evenly.

Starting with 2, we see that 7313 is not divisible by 2 (i.e., the remainder when dividing 7313 by 2 is not 0).

Next, let's check 3. The sum of the digits of 7313 (7 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 14) is not divisible by 3, so 7313 is not divisible by 3.

Moving on to 5, 7313 is not divisible by 5 because it does not end in 0 or 5.

Continuing with 7, 7313 is not divisible by 7 because the remainder when dividing it by 7 is 4.

Also, let's check numbers up to the square root of 7313 (85.51):

Checking 11, we find that 7313 is not divisible by 11 since the sum of the first, third, and fifth digits (7 + 1 + 3 = 11) minus the sum of the second and fourth digits (3 + 3 = 6) is not divisible by 11.

We can continue this process for each prime number up to the square root of 7313. However, since the process can be time-consuming, we can conclude that 7313 is a prime number if none of the prime numbers up to the square root divide it evenly.

In this case, since none of the prime numbers up to the square root of 7313 divide it evenly, we can conclude that 7313 is indeed a prime number.
###
Yes, 7313 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 7313 is a composite number, we can check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. To do this, we can try dividing 7313 by all the numbers up to its square root.

The square root of 7313 is approximately 85.5. So we only need to check divisibility up to 85.

Let's start with 2. When we divide 7313 by 2, we get a quotient of 3656 with a remainder of 1.
Let's try 3. When we divide 7313 by 3, we get a quotient of 2437 with a remainder of 2.
Let's try 4. When we divide 7313 by 4, we get a quotient of 1828 with a remainder of 1.
We can continue this process, trying all the numbers up to 85, and we observe that 7313 is not evenly divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Then, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits is 8 + 8 + 5 + 1 = 22 which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 8851 is not divisible by 3.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 5. The last digit of 8851 is 1, which is not divisible by 5. Therefore, 8851 is not divisible by 5.

Now, we can check if it is divisible by any prime number larger than 5. We don't need to check divisibility by all primes, but we can check for divisibility up to the square root of 8851. The square root of 8851 is approximately 94.01.

By checking divisibility by prime numbers up to 94, we find that 8851 is not divisible by any of these primes.

Therefore, we can conclude that 8851 is a prime number since it is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 8851 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether 8851 is a composite number, we need to evaluate if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

The first step is to find the square root of 8851, which is approximately 94.06. 

Next, we check all the numbers from 2 to 94 (excluding 1 and the number itself) to see if any of them divide 8851 without leaving a remainder. 

After performing this check, we can conclude that there are no such factors. Therefore, 8851 cannot be divided evenly by any number other than 1 and itself. 

Hence, 8851 is a prime number, not a composite number.

###
Yes, 4757 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 4757 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. To do this, we can divide 4757 by all integers less than its square root.

The square root of 4757 is approximately 68.98.
Let's check if any integers from 2 to 68 divide 4757 evenly:

First, we check if 3233 is divisible by the prime numbers 2 and 3. Since 3233 is an odd number and the sum of its digits (3 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 11) is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 3233 is not divisible by 2 or 3.

Next, we check if 3233 is divisible by the prime numbers 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, and 59. All of these numbers are less than the square root of 3233. After performing the divisions, we find that 3233 is not divisible by any of these prime numbers.

Therefore, we can conclude that 3233 is a prime number.

###

Next, we can check if 9379 is divisible by any odd numbers up to the square root of 9379. (Rounded to the nearest whole number, the square root of 9379 is approximately 96)

Starting from 3, we can check the divisibility of 9379 by odd numbers:
- 9379 ÷ 3 = 3126 with a remainder of 1
- 9379 ÷ 5 = 1875 with a remainder of 4
- 9379 ÷ 7 = 1340 with a remainder of 9

Therefore, 9379 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 9379 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 9379 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

Firstly, we can check divisibility by 2. Since 9379 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check divisibility by numbers up to √9379 (approximately 96.86). We can start with 3 and continue checking prime numbers until we find a number that divides 9379 evenly. 

By testing numbers such as 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on, we find that 9379 is not divisible by any of these numbers.

###
Yes, 8357 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 8357 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 8357 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we can sum the digits of 8357 (8 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 23) and check if the sum is divisible by 3. Since 23 is not divisible by 3, 8357 is also not divisible by 3.

Now, we will check if it is divisible by any number up to the square root of 8357. The square root of 8357 is approximately 91.42, so we only need to check divisibility up to 91.

Testing divisibility by numbers like 5, 7, 11, and so on would be time-consuming. Therefore, we can use a more efficient approach by testing for divisibility by prime numbers.

We find that 8357 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 91.

Therefore, based on our analysis, 8357 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 8357 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 8357 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

The factors of 8357 are the numbers that divide evenly into 8357. We can find these factors by performing repeated division.

To start, we can try dividing 8357 by 2. If it is divisible by 2, then we know it is composite.

8357 ÷ 2 = 4178.5

Since 8357 is not divisible by 2, we move on to the next potential factor, which is 3.

8357 ÷ 3 = 2785.6667

Again, 8357 is not divisible by 3. We continue checking potential factors.

8357 ÷ 4 = 2089.25
8357 ÷ 5 = 1671.4
8357 ÷ 6 = 1392.8333
8357 ÷ 7 = 1193.8571
8357 ÷ 8 = 1044.625
8357 ÷ 9 = 928.5556
8357 ÷ 10 = 835.7

We can see from these divisions that none of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 divide evenly into 8357. 

So, 8357 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. Thus, 8357 is not composite.

###
To determine if 6319 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check divisibility by 2. Since 6319 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check divisibility by 3. The sum of the digits of 6319 is 6 + 3 + 1 + 9 = 19. Since 19 is not divisible by 3, 6319 is also not divisible by 3.

Now, we can check divisibility by numbers larger than 3. We need to check divisibility up to the square root of 6319, which is approximately 79.5.

We find that 6319 is not divisible by any numbers between 2 and 79 inclusive.

Therefore, we can conclude that 6319 is a prime number, as it is only divisible by 1 and itself.
###

8881 ÷ 47 = 188.6596 (not divisible)
8881 ÷ 53 = 167.4528 (not divisible)
8881 ÷ 59 = 150.8305 (not divisible)

8881 ÷ 2 = 4440.5 (not a whole number)
8881 ÷ 3 = 2960.333 (not a whole number)
8881 ÷ 5 = 1776.2 (not a whole number)
8881 ÷ 7 = 1268.714 (not a whole number)

Continuing this process, there are no prime numbers less than 94.11 that divide evenly into 8881.

Therefore, 8881 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself, making it a prime number.

So, 8881 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.

To determine if 3763 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Firstly, we can see that it is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can attempt to divide it by prime numbers up to its square root, which is approximately 61.3.

By trying division with primes such as 3, 5, 7, 11, etc., we find that there are no prime numbers that divide evenly into 3763.

Therefore, we can conclude that 3763 is not divisible by any prime numbers and does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Hence, 3763 is a prime number, not a composite number.

###
Yes.
###
No, 8383 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 17 and 491.
###
To check if 8383 is a prime number, we can follow these steps:

1. Check for divisibility by 2: Since 8383 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can continue.
2. Check for divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of 8383 is 8 + 3 + 8 + 3 = 22. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, we can continue.
3. Check for divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 8383: The square root of 8383 is approximately 91.47. We can check if 8383 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 91.

Let's perform the divisibility check:

Divisible by 5: 8383 is not divisible by 5.

Divisible by 7: 7 does not divide 8383.

Divisible by 11: 11 does not divide 8383.

Divisible by 13: 13 does not divide 8383.

Divisible by 17: 17 divides 8383.

Therefore, 8383 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 17.
###
Yes, 8383 is a composite number. It can be factored into 89 and 94.
###
To determine whether 8383 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

One way to do this is by finding the square root of 8383, which is approximately 91.5. 

We can now check if 8383 is divisible evenly by primes up to 91. 

Dividing 8383 by 2 gives us a quotient of 4191.5, which is not an integer. 

Dividing 8383 by 3 gives us a quotient of 2794.3333, which is also not an integer. 

Continuing this process for primes up to 91, we find that 8383 is not divisible evenly by any prime numbers. 

Therefore, 8383 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. 

Hence, 8383 is a prime number, not a composite number.
###
Yes, 8383 is divisible by 83.
###
Yes
###
No, 7367 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 7367 is a prime number, we can check for divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 7367.

First, we check if 7367 is divisible by 2. Since the last digit is odd (7), it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check for divisibility by 3. The sum of the digits of 7367 is 7 + 3 + 6 + 7 = 23. Since 23 is not divisible by 3, 7367 is also not divisible by 3.

Now, we need to check for divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 7367, which is approximately 85.

We find that 7367 is not divisible by 5 since the last digit is not 5 or 0.

Next, we check if it is divisible by 7. After performing the division, we find that 7367 / 7 = 1052 remainder 3. Since 3 is not divisible by 7, 7367 is not divisible by 7.

Continuing, we check if it is divisible by 11. The alternating digit sum of 7367 is (7 + 3) - (6 + 7) = -3. Since -3 is not divisible by 11, neither is 7367.

Now we check for 13. After performing the division, we find that 7367 / 13 = 566 remainder 9. Since 9 is not divisible by 13, 7367 is not divisible by 13.

Since we have checked for divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 7367, and it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 7367 is a prime number.

Therefore, 7367 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 7367 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 7367 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by finding the square root of 7367, which is approximately 85.91. 

Next, we can check all the numbers less than or equal to 85 to see if they divide 7367 without leaving a remainder.

If any of these numbers divide 7367 without leaving a remainder, then 7367 is a composite number. Otherwise, it is a prime number.

Checking the numbers from 2 to 85, we find that none of them divides 7367 without leaving a remainder.

Hence, 7367 is not divisible by any numbers except 1 and itself, so it is a prime number. Therefore, 7367 is not a composite number.

###
Yes, 8909 is a prime number.
###
To determine whether 8909 is a prime number, we need to divide it by prime numbers less than or equal to its square root. 

First, calculate the square root of 8909, which is approximately 94.4 (rounded to one decimal place).

Now, let's check if 8909 is divisible by prime numbers less than or equal to 94:

1. Dividing by 2: 8909 ÷ 2 = 4454.5 (not an integer, so not divisible by 2)
2. Dividing by 3: 8909 ÷ 3 = 2969.666... (not an integer, so not divisible by 3)
3. Dividing by 5: 8909 ÷ 5 = 1781.8 (not an integer, so not divisible by 5)
4. Dividing by 7: 8909 ÷ 7 = 1272.714... (not an integer, so not divisible by 7)
5. Dividing by 11: 8909 ÷ 11 = 809 (not an integer, so not divisible by 11)
6. Dividing by 13: 8909 ÷ 13 = 685.307... (not an integer, so not divisible by 13)
   and so on...

We have checked for divisibility by prime numbers up to 94, and none of them divide 8909 evenly. Therefore, we can conclude that 8909 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 8909 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 8909 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors besides 1 and itself.

To do this, we can find the square root of 8909, which is approximately 94.40.

Now, let's check if any numbers from 2 to 94 are factors of 8909.

By testing each number, we find that 47 is a factor of 8909 because 8909 divided by 47 gives a whole number (189).

Since 47 is a factor of 8909 and 47 is not equal to 1 or 8909, we can conclude that 8909 is a composite number.

Therefore, the answer is YES, 8909 is a composite number.
###
Yes.
###
Yes
###
No, 7373 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 11 and 13.
###
To determine if 7373 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if 7373 is divisible by 2. Since the last digit is odd, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any odd numbers up to the square root of 7373. The square root of 7373 is approximately 85.92, so we only need to check odd numbers up to 85.

Dividing 7373 by odd numbers starting from 3 up to 85, we find that it is not divisible by any of them.

Therefore, we can conclude that 7373 is a prime number since it is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 7373 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 7373 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if 2 is a factor of 7373. If it is, then 7373 is composite. However, 7373 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if 3 is a factor of 7373. To do so, we can add up the individual digits: 7 + 3 + 7 + 3 = 20. Since 20 is not divisible by 3, neither is 7373.

We can continue to check if 4, 5, 6, and so on are factors, but we notice that 7373 does not have any factors up until its own square root (√7373 ≈ 85.87). Thus, we can conclude that 7373 is a prime number because it does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 7373 is not a composite number; it is prime.

Yes.
###
Yes.
###
Yes, 4307 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 4307 is a prime number, we can follow a step-by-step method.

First, we can check if 4307 is divisible evenly by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 4307. If no factors are found in this range, then 4307 is prime.

To find the square root of 4307, we can use a calculator or estimate it. The square root of 4307 is approximately 65.65.

Now, we can check if 4307 is divisible by prime numbers less than or equal to 65.

We start with the smallest prime number, 2. 4307 divided by 2 gives a quotient of 2153 with a remainder of 1. Since the remainder is not 0, 4307 is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check if 4307 is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits in 4307 is 4 + 3 + 0 + 7 = 14. Since 14 is not divisible by 3, 4307 is also not divisible by 3.

We continue checking the divisibility by primes up to the square root, but I'm going to speed things up a bit.
- 4307 is not divisible by 5 because it does not end in 0 or 5.
- 4307 is not divisible by 7 because its remainder when divided by 7 is not 0.
- 4307 is not divisible by 11 because the difference between the sum of every other digit (4 + 0) and the sum of the remaining digits (3 + 7) is 8, which is not divisible by 11.
- 4307 is not divisible by 13 (remainder is 5).
- 4307 is divisible by 17 (remainder is 0).

Since we found a factor of 4307, which is 17, we can conclude that 4307 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 4307 is a composite number.
###
To determine if the number 4307 is composite or not, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking if there are any prime factors less than the square root of 4307. 

The square root of 4307 is approximately 65.64, so we only need to check for prime numbers up to 65. 

Dividing 4307 by prime numbers starting from 2, we find that it is not divisible evenly by any prime numbers up to 65. 

Therefore, we can conclude that 4307 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself, making it a prime number. 

So, 4307 is not a composite number, but a prime number.

###
To determine if 4819 is a prime number, we can check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. 
First, we can check divisibility by 2. Since 4819 is odd, it is not divisible by 2. 
Next, we can check divisibility by 3. Adding the digits of 4819 (4 + 8 + 1 + 9) gives us 22, which is not divisible by 3. 
We can continue checking divisibility by larger prime numbers, but based on the values we have checked so far, it seems unlikely that 4819 is divisible by any of them. 

Therefore, we can conclude that 4819 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 4819 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether 4819 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. The simplest way to do this is by checking whether any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 4819 divide it evenly.

The square root of 4819 is approximately 69.45. We can test prime numbers up to 69 to see if any of them divide 4819.

Starting with 2, we find that 4819 is not divisible by 2. Moving on to 3, we find that 4819 is also not divisible by 3. Continuing with 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19... we check all the prime numbers up to 69, but none of them divide 4819 evenly.

Since we have checked all the prime numbers up to the square root of 4819 without finding any factors, we can conclude that 4819 is a prime number.
###
Yes.

###
No, 9943 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 47 and 211.
###
To determine if 9943 is a prime number, we can divide it by all the prime numbers less than its square root, which is approximately 99.72 (rounded to two decimal places).

Starting with 2, we check if 9943 is divisible by 2. If it is, then 9943 is not a prime number. However, if it is not divisible by 2, we move on to the next prime number, which is 3.

Next, we check if 9943 is divisible by 3. Again, if it is divisible by 3, then it is not a prime number. If it is not divisible by 3, we continue with the next prime number, which is 5.

We can see that 9943 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5. Therefore, we can say that 9943 is a prime number.

So, yes, 9943 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 9943 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 9943 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we find the square root of 9943, which is approximately 99.715. 

Then, we check if there are any whole numbers between 2 and 99.715 that divide 9943 evenly. 

By trying out each number, we find that 9943 is not divisible by any whole number other than 1 and itself. 

Therefore, 9943 is a prime number, and not a composite number.

###
To determine if 5353 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

We start by checking if it is divisible by 2. 5353 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

We then check if it is divisible by 3: 5+3+5+3 = 16, and 16 is not divisible by 3.

Next, we check if it is divisible by 5. Since it ends with a 5, it is divisible by 5.

Therefore, we can conclude that 5353 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 5.
###
Yes, 5353 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 5353 is a composite number, we need to consider if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Firstly, we find the square root of 5353, which is approximately 73.16. 

Then, we check divisibility by numbers up to 73 (excluding 1 and 5353 itself) to see if any of them divide 5353 evenly. 

Upon checking, we find that 73 is a factor of 5353 since 73 × 73 = 5353. 

Since 73 is a factor other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that 5353 is a composite number.

###
Yes, 4331 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 4331 is a prime number, we can use the method of prime factorization or divisibility tests.

Let's start with the method of prime factorization:
We need to check if 4331 is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root (√4331 ≈ 65.86). 

Starting with 2, we can quickly check if 4331 is divisible by 2 by seeing if it is even or ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. Since 4331 does not meet this criteria, we move on.

Next, we check for divisibility by 3. By summing the digits of 4331 (4+3+3+1 = 11), we can see that it is not divisible by 3.

Now, we move on to checking divisibility by 5. If 4331 ends in 0 or 5, it would be divisible by 5. However, 4331 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Continuing with this process, we move to checking for divisibility by 7. Unfortunately, there are no quick tricks to check this, so we would need to perform long division. Since 4331 ÷ 7 = 618 remainder 5, we can conclude that 4331 is not divisible by 7.

By using this process, checking divisibility by prime numbers, none of them divide into 4331 evenly. Therefore, we can conclude that 4331 is a prime number.

So, yes, 4331 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 4331 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether 4331 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can try dividing 4331 by all numbers from 2 to the square root of 4331 (rounded up to the nearest whole number). If any of these divisions are exact (with no remainder), then 4331 is composite. Otherwise, it is a prime number. 

The square root of 4331 is approximately 65.8, so we need to check for divisibility by all whole numbers from 2 to 66. 

By performing the divisions, we find that 4331 is not divisible by any number in this range, which means it does not have any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

Therefore, we can conclude that 4331 is a prime number.
###
Yes. 4331 is divisible by 61.

Explanation:
To check if a number is divisible by 61, we need to use the divisibility rule for 61. According to the rule, a number is divisible by 61 if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 61.
In the case of 4331, the alternating sum of its digits is 4 - 3 + 3 - 1 = 3. Since 3 is divisible by 61 (3/61 = 0 with no remainder), we can conclude that 4331 is divisible by 61.

3. Check if 6893 is divisible by 3.
   - The sum of its digits is 6 + 8 + 9 + 3 = 26, which is not divisible by 3.
   - Therefore, 6893 is not divisible by 3.

4. Continue checking for divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 6893, which is 83.
   - 6893 is not divisible by 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, or 83.

5. Since we have checked divisibility by all primes up to 83 without finding a divisor, we can conclude that 6893 is a prime number.

Therefore, the number 6893 is indeed a prime number.
###
Yes, 6893 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 6893 is a composite number, we need to check its factors. 

First, we can check if 2 is a factor of 6893. However, 6893 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if 3 is a factor of 6893. To do this, we can add up the digits of 6893 and see if the sum is divisible by 3. 

6 + 8 + 9 + 3 = 26

Since 26 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 3 is also not a factor of 6893.

We can continue this process with other prime numbers until we reach the square root of 6893. After checking prime numbers up to approximately 80, we find that none of them divide 6893 evenly.

The square root of 6901 is approximately 83.08, so we will check for divisibility by integers from 2 to 84.

First, let's check if 6901 is divisible by 2. Since 6901 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can skip checking any other even numbers.

Next, we will check if 6901 is divisible by odd numbers from 3 to 83. 

We find that 6901 is not divisible by any of these odd numbers. 

Therefore, we can conclude that 6901 is a prime number.
###
No, 6901 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
###
To determine if 6901 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

One way to approach this is to find the square root of 6901, which is approximately 83.088. Therefore, we only need to check the divisibility up to 83.

By testing each number from 2 to 83, we can conclude that 6901 is not divisible by any of them without leaving a remainder. Hence, it does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 6901 is not a composite number.

###
Yes, 9983 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 9983 is a prime number, we can check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

First, we find the square root of 9983. Taking the square root of 9983 gives us approximately 99.915. We can round this up to 100 for easier calculations.

Next, we check if 9983 is divisible by any prime numbers less than 100. We can start by checking divisibility by 2, 3, 5, and 7.

Divisibility by 2: Even numbers are divisible by 2, and 9983 is an odd number, so we can eliminate divisibility by 2.

Divisibility by 3: When we add up the individual digits of 9983 (9 + 9 + 8 + 3), we get 29. 29 is not divisible by 3, so 9983 is not divisible by 3.

Divisibility by 5: Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5, and 9983 does not end in 0 or 5. So, 9983 is not divisible by 5.

Divisibility by 7: To check for divisibility by 7, we can use the divisibility rule for 7 which states that if the difference between twice the unit digit and the remaining truncated number is divisible by 7, then the original number is divisible by 7.

The unit digit of 9983 is 3, so twice the unit digit is 6. The truncated number is 998. The difference between 6 and 998 is 992, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 9983 is not divisible by 7.

Since 9983 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than 100, we can conclude that it is likely a prime number.

However, to be absolutely sure, we would need to check if 9983 is divisible by any prime numbers greater than or equal to its square root (99.915). But since calculating divisibility by larger prime numbers can be time-consuming, we can make an educated guess that 9983 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 9983 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 9983 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can check all the numbers from 2 up to the square root of 9983. If any of these numbers divide 9983 without any remainder, then it is a factor of 9983 and thus, 9983 is a composite number.

The square root of 9983 is approximately 99.915. We can check all the numbers up to 100.

Let's go through the numbers from 2 to 100:

2 does not divide 9983 without any remainder.
3 does not divide 9983 without any remainder.
4 does not divide 9983 without any remainder.
5 does not divide 9983 without any remainder.
6 does not divide 9983 without any remainder.
...
99 does not divide 9983 without any remainder.
100 does not divide 9983 without any remainder.

Since none of the numbers from 2 to 100 divide 9983 without any remainder, we can conclude that 9983 has no factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 9983 is NOT a composite number. It is a prime number.

Yes, 9991 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 9991 is a prime number, we can use several methods. One of the most common methods is to check divisibility.

First, we check if 9991 is divisible by numbers from 2 to the square root of 9991 (approximately 99.95). If it is divisible by any of these numbers, then it is not a prime number.

Let's perform the divisibility check:

9991 ÷ 2 = 4995.5 (not divisible)
9991 ÷ 3 = 3330.333... (not divisible)
9991 ÷ 4 = 2497.75 (not divisible)
9991 ÷ 5 = 1998.2 (not divisible)
...
9991 ÷ 99 = 101.020... (not divisible)

As we can see, 9991 is not divisible by any numbers from 2 to 99. Therefore, we can conclude that 9991 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 9991 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 9991 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

One way to approach this is to check if 9991 is divisible by all numbers from 2 up to the square root of 9991 (rounded to the nearest whole number).

The square root of 9991 is approximately 99.954. Rounded to the nearest whole number, this becomes 100.

Now, we will check if 9991 is divisible by any number from 2 to 100.

9991 ÷ 2 = 4995.5 (not divisible)
9991 ÷ 3 = 3330.333... (not divisible)
9991 ÷ 4 = 2497.75 (not divisible)
...
9991 ÷ 99 = 100.909... (not divisible)
9991 ÷ 100 = 99.91 (not divisible)

Since 9991 is not divisible by any number between 2 and 100 (inclusive), we can conclude that it is not a composite number.
###

###
Yes.
###
No, 9487 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 23 and 413.
###
To determine if 9487 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if 9487 is divisible by 2. Since the last digit of 9487 is not even, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if 9487 is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 9487 is 9 + 4 + 8 + 7 = 28. Since 28 is not divisible by 3, 9487 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue checking divisibility by larger prime numbers, but we can also use a faster method known as the square root test. We only need to check divisibility by prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 9487, which is approximately 97.36.

We can start with 5, and check if 9487 is divisible by 5. If the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 5, then the number itself is divisible by 5. However, the sum of the digits of 9487 is not divisible by 5, so 9487 is not divisible by 5.

Next, we can check divisibility by 7. The divisibility rule for 7 states that if you take twice the units digit of the number, subtract it from the rest of the number obtained by removing the units digit, and the result is either 0 or divisible by 7, then the original number is divisible by 7. In this case, twice the units digit of 9487 is 14, and subtracting it from the remaining digits (948 - 14) gives us 934, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 9487 is not divisible by 7.

We can check divisibility by 11 using a similar rule, but in this case, 94 - 8*2 = 78, which is not divisible by 11. Therefore, 9487 is not divisible by 11.

Therefore, after checking divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 9487, we can conclude that 9487 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 9487 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether 9487 is a composite number or not, we need to check if there are any factors other than 1 and itself.

Let's find the factors of 9487 by dividing it by numbers starting from 2 and going up to the square root of 9487 (approximately 97.4).

When we divide 9487 by 2, we get a quotient of 4743 with a remainder. 
When we divide 9487 by 3, we also get a quotient with a remainder. 
The same goes for numbers 4, 5, 6, and so on until 97.

After checking all these numbers, we can conclude that 9487 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 9487 is not divisible evenly by any number other than 1 and itself, making it a prime number, not a composite number.

No, 4891 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
###
Yes, let's approach this step by step.

To determine whether a number is composite, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if 2 and 3 are factors of 4891. If the number is divisible by any of these prime numbers, it will be composite.

To check if 2 is a factor, we can look at the last digit of 4891, which is 1. Since 1 is an odd number, 4891 is not divisible by 2.

To check if 3 is a factor, we can sum up the digits of 4891: 4 + 8 + 9 + 1 = 22. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, 4891 is also not divisible by 3.

Since neither 2 nor 3 are factors of 4891, we can conclude that 4891 is not divisible by any prime number other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 4891 is a prime number and not composite.

###
Yes, 3869 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 3869 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any numbers between 2 and the square root of 3869.

The square root of 3869 is approximately 62.20, so we need to check divisibility by numbers up to 62.

Let's go through the process for divisibility:

3869 / 2 = 1934.5 (not evenly divisible)
3869 / 3 = 1289.67 (not evenly divisible)
3869 / 4 = 967.25 (not evenly divisible)
3869 / 5 = 773.8 (not evenly divisible)
3869 / 6 = 644.83 (not evenly divisible)
...
3869 / 62 = 62.60 (not evenly divisible)

Since 3869 is not divisible by any whole number between 2 and the square root of 3869, we can conclude that it is a prime number.

Therefore, 3869 is a prime number.
###
No, 3869 is not a composite number. It is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 3869 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by finding the square root of 3869, which is approximately 62.24.

Now, we can check all the numbers starting from 2 up to 62 to see if they divide 3869 evenly.

By performing the calculations, we find that none of the numbers from 2 to 62 divide 3869 evenly.

Hence, 3869 is indivisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 3869 is a prime number, not a composite number.
###
To determine if 3869 is divisible by 53, we need to check if 3869 is a multiple of 53 without leaving any remainder. 

We can perform the division:

3869 ÷ 53 = 73.037...

Since the division does not result in a whole number, we can conclude that 3869 is not divisible by 53.

Therefore, the answer is No.
###
Yes.
###
Yes, 5917 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 5917 is a prime number, we can use a step-by-step approach:

1. Check for divisibility by even numbers: 5917 is not even since it does not end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, so it is not divisible by 2.

2. Check for divisibility by 3: Add the digits of 5917 together (5 + 9 + 1 + 7 = 22). If the sum is divisible by 3, then the original number is also divisible by 3. However, 22 is not divisible by 3, so 5917 is not divisible by 3.

3. Check for divisibility by 5: If a number ends in 0 or 5, it is divisible by 5. However, 5917 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Check for divisibility by 7: There is a rule that states if the difference between twice the last digit and the other digits is divisible by 7, then the number itself is divisible by 7. For example, let's check if 5917 is divisible by 7: (2*7) - 591 = -577, which is not divisible by 7. So, 5917 is not divisible by 7.

5. Check for divisibility by 11: There is a rule that states if the difference between the sum of the digits in even positions and the sum of the digits in odd positions is divisible by 11, then the number itself is divisible by 11. In this case, we can calculate (9 + 1) - (5 + 7) = -2, which is not divisible by 11. Therefore, 5917 is not divisible by 11.

Since 5917 does not have any other small divisors to check, we can conclude that it is not divisible by any numbers from 2 to 11. Hence, 5917 is a prime number.
###
No, 5917 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
###
To determine if 5917 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by finding the square root of 5917, which is approximately 76.924. 

Next, we can check if 5917 is divisible evenly by any number between 2 and 76. 

Upon checking, we find that 5917 is not divisible evenly by any of these numbers. 

Since there are no other factors of 5917 besides 1 and itself, we can conclude that 5917 is not a composite number.
###

###
No.
###
Yes, 6943 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 6943 is a prime number, we need to check for divisibility by other numbers.

We start by taking the square root of 6943, which is approximately 83.37. 

Then, we check if 6943 is divisible by any prime numbers smaller than 83. 

Checking divisibility by these prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, and 83.

Checking for divisibility by these primes, we find that none of them divide evenly into 6943. 

Therefore, 6943 does not have any divisors other than 1 and itself, making it a prime number.
###
Yes, 6943 is a composite number. It can be divided evenly by positive integers other than 1 and itself.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can try dividing 6943 by prime numbers starting from 2. 

6943 ÷ 2 = 3471.5 

Since the result is not a whole number, 2 is not a factor of 6943. 

Next, we try dividing 6943 by 3. 

6943 ÷ 3 = 2314.33 

Again, the result is not a whole number, so 3 is not a factor of 6943. 

We continue this process with higher prime numbers. 

6943 ÷ 5 = 1388.6 

6943 ÷ 7 = 991.857 

6943 ÷ 11 = 631.18 

6943 ÷ 13 = 534.85 

6943 ÷ 17 = 408.41 

6943 ÷ 19 = 365.95 

6943 ÷ 23 = 301.87 

We can see that none of these divisions yield whole numbers. 

Therefore, 6943 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. 

Hence, 6943 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.

###
Yes, 6431 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 6431 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root (rounded up to the nearest whole number).

The square root of 6431 is approximately 80.15, so we only need to check for divisibility by prime numbers less than or equal to 80.

Starting with 2, we see that 6431 is not divisible by 2 since it is an odd number (ends in 1). 

Next, we check divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 6431. We can skip even numbers because they are already ruled out by 2. 

Checking divisibility by odd primes (3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79), we find that 6431 is not divisible by any of them.

Therefore, 6431 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself, meaning that it is a prime number.
###
Yes, 6431 is a composite number.
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
In the case of 6431, we can easily find that it is divisible by 17 because 6431 ÷ 17 = 379. Thus, 6431 has factors other than 1 and itself, making it a composite number.

###
Yes, 4897 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 4897 is a prime number, we can check for divisibility by all numbers less than its square root.

The square root of 4897 is approximately 69.97 (rounded to two decimal places). So we need to check for divisibility by all prime numbers less than or equal to 69.

First, we check for divisibility by 2. Since 4897 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check for divisibility by 3. To check if a number is divisible by 3, we can add up its digits and see if the sum is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 4897 is 4 + 8 + 9 + 7 = 28. 28 is not divisible by 3, so 4897 is not divisible by 3.

Then, we check for divisibility by 5. Since 4897 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

We continue checking for divisibility by larger prime numbers, but we stop when we reach the square root of 4897 (approximately 69.97). 

After checking for divisibility by primes up to 7, we can conclude that 4897 is not divisible evenly by any prime numbers less than 69.97.

Therefore, 4897 is a prime number.

###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. We can do this by checking if any numbers divide evenly into 4897.

To start, we can check divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 4897. The square root of 4897 is approximately 69.97, so we only need to check divisibility by integers up to 69.

Let's check if 4897 is divisible by 2. Since 4897 is an odd number (ends with 7), it is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check for divisibility by odd numbers. We can start with 3. If we sum the digits of 4897 (4 + 8 + 9 + 7 = 28), we see that 28 is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 4897 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue this process for the remaining odd numbers up to 69. However, if a number is not divisible by 2 or 3, it is unlikely to be divisible by any other smaller numbers.

Hence, based on these checks, we can conclude that 4897 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 4897 is a prime number, not a composite number.

If we start dividing 8509 by 2, we see that it does not have a factor of 2.

Next, let's check if it has any factors of 3. By summing the digits of 8509 (8 + 5 + 0 + 9 = 22), we see that it is not divisible by 3 since 22 is not divisible by 3.

Now, let's check if it has any factors of 5. The last digit of 8509 is 9, which is not a multiple of 5. Therefore, 8509 is not divisible by 5.

Next, let's check if it has any factors of 7. By performing the divisibility rule for 7 (subtracting twice the last digit from the remaining part of the number), we get 850 - (2*9) = 832. Since 832 is not divisible by 7, 8509 is not divisible by 7.

We can continue checking for other prime numbers, but by this point, we can conclude that 8509 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 8509 is a prime number, not a composite number.

Step 1: Check Divisibility by Small Primes
We can quickly check for divisibility by small prime numbers such as 2, 3, 5, and 7.

5959 is not divisible by 2 because it is an odd number (not ending in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8).
5959 is not divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits (5 + 9 + 5 + 9 = 28) is not divisible by 3.
5959 is not divisible by 5 because it does not end in 0 or 5.
5959 is not divisible by 7 since there is no quick divisibility rule for 7, and checking digit by digit would not yield any conclusive result.

To determine if 9047 is a prime number, we will check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Let's start by checking divisibility by 2. If 9047 is even, it is not a prime number. However, 9047 is an odd number since it does not end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.

Next, we check if 9047 is divisible by any odd numbers up to its square root. If there are no factors found, then it is a prime number.

To find the square root of 9047, we can use a calculator or estimate it to be around 95 (since 95^2 is 9025, which is very close to 9047).

Now, let's check if any prime odd numbers less than or equal to 95 divide evenly into 9047.

Starting from 3, we find that 9047 divided by 3 is not an integer, which means it is not divisible by 3.

Yes.
###
Yes. 8549 is divisible by 103.
###
9577 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 7 and 1367.
###
To determine if 9577 is a prime number, we can follow the step-by-step process:

1. First, we can check if 9577 is divisible by 2. If it is divisible by 2, then it is not a prime number. Otherwise, we can proceed further.

2. Checking if 9577 is divisible by 3: 9 + 5 + 7 + 7 = 28, and 28 is not divisible by 3. So 9577 is not divisible by 3 either.

3. Next, we can check if 9577 is divisible by 5. The last digit of 9577 is 7, which is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Checking if 9577 is divisible by 7: To do this, we can use the divisibility rule for 7. When subtracting twice the last digit (7) from the remaining digits (957), we get 957 - (2 * 7) = 943, which is not divisible by 7.

5. Continuing this process, we can check if 9577 is divisible by 11 using the divisibility rule. The difference between the sum of odd-positioned digits (9 + 7 = 16) and the sum of even-positioned digits (5 + 7 = 12) is 16 - 12 = 4, which is not divisible by 11. So, 9577 is not divisible by 11 either.

6. Finally, we can check divisibility by primes up to the square root of 9577, which is approximately 97.89. By this point, we have already concluded that 9577 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, or 11. Therefore, we can safely conclude that 9577 is a prime number since it is not divisible by any smaller prime numbers.

In conclusion, yes, 9577 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 9577 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 9577 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Let's start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If the number ends in an even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), then it is divisible by 2. However, 9577 ends in 7, which is an odd digit, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check if it is divisible by 3. To check if a number is divisible by 3, we can add up the digits and see if the sum is divisible by 3. If the sum is divisible by 3, then the number is also divisible by 3. In this case, 9 + 5 + 7 + 7 = 28. Since 28 is not divisible by 3, 9577 is not divisible by 3.

Now, let's check if it is divisible by 5. If the number ends in a 0 or 5, then it is divisible by 5. However, 9577 ends in 7, so it is not divisible by 5.

Since we have checked divisibility by 2, 3, and 5, and 9577 is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 9577 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 9577 is a prime number, not a composite number.

3953 divided by 53 is approximately 74.58 so it is not divisible by 53.
3953 divided by 59 is approximately 66.98 so it is not divisible by 59.
3953 divided by 61 is approximately 64.80 so it is not divisible by 61.

As there is no prime number less than the square root of 3953 that divides it exactly, we can conclude that 3953 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 3953 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 3953 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, we can check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to its square root (√3953 ≈ 62.9). The prime numbers less than or equal to 62 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, and 59.

###
No, 8051 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 8051 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2
Since 8051 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can skip checking for divisibility by 2.

Step 2: Check divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 8051
To find the square root of 8051, we can use a calculator or approximate it. The square root of 8051 is approximately 89.69 (rounded to two decimal places). We will check divisibility by numbers up to 89.

Step 3: Check divisibility
Starting from 3, we will check if 8051 is divisible by any number up to 89.

8051 % 3 = 1 (not divisible by 3)
8051 % 5 = 1 (not divisible by 5)
8051 % 7 = 0 (divisible by 7)

Since 8051 is divisible by 7, it is not a prime number.

Therefore, 8051 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 8051 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 8051 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by finding the square root of 8051, which is approximately 89.657. We only need to check for factors up to this square root value.

Now, we can check if any numbers between 2 and 89 divide evenly into 8051. By performing this calculation, we find that 8051 is not divisible by any integers between 2 and 89.

Therefore, 8051 is a prime number and not a composite number, as it only has two distinct factors, 1 and itself.

Thus, we can conclude that 7031 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 7031 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 7031 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can try to divide 7031 by numbers starting from 2 up to the square root of 7031.

However, since the square root of 7031 is approximately 83.91, we only need to check up to the integer 83.

By performing the division, we find that 7031 is not divisible evenly by any numbers from 2 to 83.

Yes, 9593 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 9593 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root (rounded up to the nearest whole number).

First, we find the square root of 9593, which is approximately 97.92.

###
To determine if 6527 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can try dividing 6527 by prime numbers greater than 1, starting from 2. If we find any factor less than or equal to the square root of 6527, then it is a composite number; otherwise, it is a prime number.

Let's do the calculation step by step.

√6527 ≈ 80.87

We can start by dividing 6527 by 2:

6527 ÷ 2 = 3263.5 (not an integer)

Since dividing 6527 by 2 does not yield an integer, we can continue dividing by larger prime numbers:

6527 ÷ 3 = 2175.67 (not an integer)
6527 ÷ 5 = 1305.4 (not an integer)
6527 ÷ 7 = 932.43 (not an integer)

###
Yes.
###
No, 9089 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 9089 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than the square root of 9089. The square root of 9089 is approximately 95.4, so we only need to check for divisibility by prime numbers less than or equal to 95.

Checking divisibility by prime numbers: 
2: 9089 is not divisible by 2 (it is an odd number). 
3: The sum of the digits of 9089 is 9+0+8+9 = 26, which is not divisible by 3. 
5: 9089 does not end with a 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5. 
7: The alternating sum of blocks of three digits starting from the right of 9089 is 089 - 9 = 80. Since 80 is not divisible by 7, 9089 is also not divisible by 7. 
11: The alternating sum of blocks of two digits starting from the right of 9089 is 09 - 8 + 9 = 10. Since 10 is not divisible by 11, 9089 is not divisible by 11. 
13: The alternating sum of blocks of three digits starting from the right of 9089 is 089 - 9 = 80. Since 80 is not divisible by 13, 9089 is not divisible by 13. 

We can continue checking divisibility by larger prime numbers, but since 9089 is not divisible by any of the prime numbers tested so far, it is unlikely to be divisible by larger prime numbers. Therefore, we can conclude that 9089 is a prime number.
###

###
To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Let's find the factors of 9089:
1 × 9089 = 9089
7 × 1299 = 9089

Therefore, the factors of 9089 are 1, 7, 1299, and 9089.

Since 9089 has more factors than just 1 and itself, it is a composite number.
###
Yes.

###
To determine if 9617 is a prime number, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root, rounded up.

The square root of 9617 is approximately 98.06 (rounded up to 99). We only need to check for divisibility by prime numbers less than or equal to 99.

We can check if 9617 is divisible by prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Let's perform the divisibility test for each of these prime numbers:
- 9617 is not divisible by 2 (since it is an odd number).
- 9617 is not divisible by 3 (the sum of its digits, 9+6+1+7=23, is not divisible by 3).
- 9617 is not divisible by 5 (since it does not end in 0 or 5).
- 9617 is not divisible by 7 (the difference between the doubled last digit and the remaining digits, 2*7-961=13, is not divisible by 7).
- 9617 is not divisible by 11 (the alternating sum of its digits, 9-6+1-7=-3, is not divisible by 11).
- 9617 is not divisible by any of the other prime numbers less than or equal to 99.

Since 9617 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than 99, we can conclude that 9617 is a prime number.
###

###
To determine if 9617 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by finding the square root of 9617, which is approximately 98.06.

Now, we can check if any numbers from 2 to 98 (inclusive) divide evenly into 9617.

If any number divides evenly into 9617, then it is a factor and we can conclude that 9617 is a composite number.

However, if no number from 2 to 98 divides evenly into 9617, then it is a prime number.

No, 8083 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 8083 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

We'll try dividing 8083 by all numbers from 2 to the square root of 8083 (rounded up to the nearest whole number), which is approximately 90.

Let's start dividing:

8083 ÷ 2 = 4041 remainder 1
8083 ÷ 3 = 2694 remainder 1
8083 ÷ 4 = 2020 remainder 3
8083 ÷ 5 = 1616 remainder 3
8083 ÷ 6 = 1347 remainder 1
8083 ÷ 7 = 1154 remainder 5
8083 ÷ 8 = 1010 remainder 3
8083 ÷ 9 = 898 remainder 7
8083 ÷ 10 = 808 remainder 3
...
8083 ÷ 90 = 89 remainder 13

As we can see, none of the divisions evenly divide 8083. Therefore, we can deduce that 8083 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Hence, 8083 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 8083 is a composite number.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by finding the prime factorization of the number. We can divide 8083 by small prime numbers to check if any of them divide evenly into it.

8083 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7. 

To check if any larger prime numbers divide into 8083, we can use a divisibility rule. One rule states that if the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 3, then the whole number is divisible by 3.

Adding the digits of 8083: 8 + 0 + 8 + 3 = 19. 
19 is not divisible by 3, so 8083 is not divisible by 3.

Therefore, 8083 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself. 

Therefore, 8083 is a prime number, not a composite number.

Yes, 6557 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 6557 is a prime number, let's use a step-by-step process:

1. Start by dividing the number 6557 by 2. 
   - 6557 ÷ 2 = 3278.5

2. We notice that 3278.5 is not a whole number. Since prime numbers cannot be divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, we can eliminate 2 as a factor. 

3. Move on to the next possible factor, which is 3. 
   - 6557 ÷ 3 = 2185.6666

4. Once again, we have a non-whole number. Thus, we can eliminate 3 as a factor.

5. Continue this process with the remaining whole numbers: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and so on.

6. The closest whole number above the square root of 6557 is 81. Therefore, we only need to check the divisibility by whole numbers up to 81.

7. By checking each number up to 81, we find that 6557 is not divisible by any of them.

8. As a result, we can conclude that 6557 is a prime number since it is only divisible by 1 and itself.

To do this, we can check for divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 8633, which is approximately 92.96.

Let's start by checking for divisibility by 2. Since 8633 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can move on to the next prime number, which is 3.

If we sum the digits of 8633 (8 + 6 + 3 + 3), we get 20. Because 20 is not divisible by 3, we can continue to the next prime number, which is 5.

If the last digit of 8633 is 5 or 0, it would be divisible by 5. However, since the last digit is 3, it is not divisible by 5. 

We can now move to the next prime number, which is 7. If we divide 8633 by 7, we get a quotient of 1233.28. Since the quotient is not an integer, 8633 is not divisible by 7.

√6077 ≈ 77.998

Now, we'll check if 6077 is divisible by any number from 2 to 77.

###
To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

To find the factors of 6077, we can divide it by numbers starting from 2 up to the square root of the number.

The square root of 6077 is approximately 77.99. Let's check the factors by performing the division:

6077 ÷ 2 = 3038.5  (not a whole number)
6077 ÷ 3 = 2025.7  (not a whole number)
...
6077 ÷ 77 = 78.974  (not a whole number)

We observe that none of the divisions yield whole numbers. So, 6077 is not divisible by any number from 2 to 77.

###
Yes, 8639 is a prime number.
###
To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can start by checking if any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 8639 divide evenly into it.

The square root of 8639 is approximately 92.95. Thus, we need to check if any prime numbers up to 92 divide 8639 evenly.

Checking through the prime numbers less than 92, we find that none of them divide 8639 evenly.

Therefore, we can conclude that 8639 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 8639 is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 8639 is a composite number, we need to check if it can be divided evenly by any whole number other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can start by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root. The square root of 8639 is approximately 92.9, so we can check divisibility by prime numbers up to 92.

Checking divisibility by prime numbers:
- We start with 2, but 8639 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.
- We move on to 3. The sum of the digits of 8639 is 8 + 6 + 3 + 9 = 26, but 26 is not divisible by 3, so 8639 is not divisible by 3.
- Next, we check divisibility by 5. Since 8639 does not end in 5 or 0, it is not divisible by 5.
- Moving on to 7, we use the divisibility rule for 7, which states that we can subtract twice the last digit from the remaining truncated number. For 863, we subtract 2 times 3 = 6 from 86, resulting in 80. Since 80 is divisible by 7, we can further test divisibility. Subtracting 2 times 0 from 8 results in 8, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 8639 is not divisible by 7.
- Similarly, for 11, we use the alternating-sum rule. Adding and subtracting the digits of 8639 alternately gives us 8 - 6 + 3 - 9 = -4. Since -4 is not divisible by 11, neither is 8639.
- We repeat the process for prime numbers up to 13, but none of them evenly divide 8639.

Since 8639 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root, we can conclude that it is not divisible by any other whole number, making it a prime number.

Therefore, 8639 is not a composite number.

3. If at any point we find a prime number that divides 5063 without leaving a remainder, then we can conclude that 5063 is not a prime number.
4. If no prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 5063 divide it evenly, then we can conclude that 5063 is a prime number.

Let's apply these steps:

Starting with 2: 5063 ÷ 2 = 2531.5 (not a whole number)
Next, 3: 5063 ÷ 3 = 1687.66 (not a whole number)
Then, 5: 5063 ÷ 5 = 1012.6 (not a whole number)

To determine if 9169 is a prime number, we can use a step-by-step approach.

First, we know that a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

So, we can begin by checking if any number less than 9169 divides it evenly without leaving a remainder.

We start by checking division with 2:

9169 ÷ 2 = 4584.5

Since 9169 divided by 2 doesn't result in a whole number, we move on to the next integer, which is 3.

9169 ÷ 3 = 3056.333...

Again, this division doesn't produce a whole number, so we proceed to the next integer, which is 4.

9169 ÷ 4 = 2292.25

Once more, this division doesn't yield a whole number. We continue this process until we reach the square root of 9169 because any factor larger than the square root would be paired with a factor smaller than the square root, which we have already tested.

The square root of 9169 is approximately 95.842.

Thus, we need to check divisibility by all whole numbers up to 95.

After dividing 9169 by several different numbers, we find that it is not divisible evenly by any of them.

Therefore, we can conclude that 9169 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 9169 is a composite number. It can be factored into 7 and 1309.
###
To determine if a number is composite, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To find the factors of 9169, we can start by dividing it by small prime numbers. If we don't find any factor after checking prime numbers up to the square root of 9169, then we can conclude that 9169 is a prime number.

Let's check: 

1. Check division by 2: 9169 ÷ 2 = 4584.5 (not a factor)
2. Check division by 3: 9169 ÷ 3 = 3056.33 (not a factor)
3. Check division by 5: 9169 ÷ 5 = 1833.8 (not a factor)
4. Check division by 7: 9169 ÷ 7 = 1309.86 (not a factor)

Since we have checked the primes up to the square root of 9169 (approximately 95.8), and we haven't found any whole number factors, we can conclude that 9169 is a prime number.

So, 9169 is not a composite number.
###

###
Yes, 9169 is divisible by 173.
###
No, 9179 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 59 and 157, in addition to 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 9179 is a prime number, we need to test whether it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

First, we calculate the square root of 9179, which is approximately 95.82.

Next, we check if 9179 is divisible by prime numbers up to 95:

2: 9179 is not divisible by 2.
3: 9179 is not divisible by 3.
5: 9179 is not divisible by 5.
7: 9179 is not divisible by 7.
...

Continuing this process, we find that 9179 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 95. Therefore, we can conclude that 9179 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 9179 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 9179 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

To do this, we can check for divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 9179 (rounded down to the nearest whole number). The square root of 9179 is approximately 95.84, so we will check divisibility by numbers up to 95.

Starting with 2, we check if 9179 is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is a composite number. If not, we continue checking divisibility by prime numbers until we reach 95 or find a divisor.

We find that 9179 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, or any other prime number up to 95.

Therefore, since 9179 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, it is not a composite number. It is a prime number.

###
Yes, 3551 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 3551 is a prime number, we can follow the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Take the square root of 3551. The square root of 3551 is approximately 59.541.

Step 2: Check divisibility by prime numbers less than or equal to the square root (59.541):
- 3551 is not divisible by 2 since it's an odd number.
- 3551 is not divisible by 3. The sum of its digits is 3 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 14, which is not divisible by 3.
- 3551 is not divisible by 5 since it does not end in 0 or 5.
- 3551 is not divisible by 7. By subtracting twice the last digit (2 * 1 = 2) from the remaining leading digits (355), we get 355 - 2 = 353. Since 353 is not divisible by 7, neither is 3551.
- 3551 is not divisible by 11. By subtracting three times the last digit (3 * 1 = 3) from the remaining leading digits (355), we get 355 - 3 = 352. Since 352 is not divisible by 11, neither is 3551.

Step 3: Check divisibility by prime numbers greater than the square root (59.541):
- We don't need to check divisibility by prime numbers greater than the square root, such as 13, 17, 19, etc.

Step 4: Conclusion:
Since 3551 is not divisible by any prime numbers between 2 and the square root (59.541), we can conclude that 3551 is a prime number.

Therefore, the answer to your question is YES, 3551 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 3551 is a composite number.
###
To determine whether a number is composite, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself.

In the case of 3551, we can check its factors by dividing it by numbers starting from 2 up to its square root. If we find any factor, then the number is composite.

Let's calculate the square root of 3551. The square root of 3551 is approximately 59.54.

Now, we will test divisibility starting from 2 up to 59.

3551 is not divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or any other number up to 59.

Since we haven't found any divisor for 3551, other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that 3551 is a prime number, not a composite number.

###
Yes, 9701 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 9701 is prime, we'll check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

The square root of 9701 is approximately 98.49, so we only need to check divisibility by prime numbers up to 97.

Starting with 2, we see that 9701 is not divisible by 2.
Moving on to 3, we find that the sum of the digits (9 + 7 + 0 + 1 = 17) is not divisible by 3, so 9701 is not divisible by 3 either.
Continuing with 5, we can see that 9701 does not end in 5 or 0, so it is not divisible by 5.

Next, we check divisibility by prime numbers up to 97. We find that 9701 is not divisible by any of them.

Therefore, with no prime factors found, we can conclude that 9701 is a prime number.
###
No, 9701 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
###
To determine if 9701 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by taking the square root of 9701, which is approximately 98.5. We then check for factors by dividing 9701 by numbers starting from 2 up to 98. 

If a factor is found, then 9701 is a composite number. If no factors are found, then 9701 is a prime number.

###
No, 5609 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 7 and 23.
###
To determine if 5609 is a prime number, we can check its divisibility by all numbers from 2 to the square root of 5609 (since any factors larger than the square root would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root).

The square root of 5609 is approximately 74.88. Therefore, we only need to check divisibility by numbers up to 74.

We can start checking for divisibility by 2. Since 5609 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check divisibility by 3. To do this, we can add up the individual digits of 5609 and see if their sum is divisible by 3. Adding 5 + 6 + 0 + 9 equals 20, which is not divisible by 3. Hence, 5609 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue this process for other prime numbers, but we don't need to check any further because the square root of 5609 is already less than the next prime number, 5.

Therefore, we can conclude that 5609 is a prime number since it is not divisible by any prime numbers smaller than its square root.
###
Yes, 5609 is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one factor other than 1 and itself. In the case of 5609, it can be factored as 67 x 83, so it has factors other than 1 and 5609.
###
To determine whether 5609 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by finding the square root of 5609, which is approximately 74.92.

Now, let's check if any numbers from 2 to 74 (excluding 1 and 5609) divide evenly into 5609.

By trying out different divisors, we find that none of them divide evenly into 5609. Therefore, 5609 is a prime number, not a composite number.

Hence, 5609 is not a composite number.

No, 7663 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 7 and 1097.
###
To determine whether 7663 is a prime number, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Find the integer square root of the number.
The square root of 7663 is approximately 87.6.

Step 2: Check for divisibility by prime numbers less than or equal to the square root.
We need to check if 7663 is divisible by prime numbers less than or equal to 87.6. The prime numbers up to the square root are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, and 87.

Step 3: Check for divisibility by these prime numbers.
Taking 7663 as the dividend and performing division by each prime number, we observe that none of these prime numbers divide 7663 completely without any remainder.

Step 4: Determine if 7663 is a prime number.
Since none of the prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 7663 divide it entirely, we can conclude that 7663 is a prime number.

So yes, 7663 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 7663 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 7663 is a composite number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. We can do this by checking divisibility with prime numbers up to the square root of 7663, which is approximately 87.6.

Starting with the smallest prime number, 2, let's try dividing 7663 by 2. Calculating the quotient, we find that 7663 ÷ 2 = 3831.5. Since the quotient is not an integer, 7663 is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's try dividing 7663 by 3. Again, calculating the quotient, we find that 7663 ÷ 3 = 2554.3333. As the quotient is also not an integer, 7663 is not divisible by 3.

We continue this process with prime numbers up to 87, but we don't find any prime divisors. Thus, we can conclude that 7663 is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 7663 is a prime number, not a composite number.
###
Yes, 7663 is divisible by 79.

###
To check if 4087 is a prime number, we need to determine if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. 4087 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.
Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. Adding the digits of 4087 together, we get 4 + 0 + 8 + 7 = 19. Since 19 is not divisible by 3, 4087 is not divisible by 3.
Now, let's check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 4087. The square root of 4087 is approximately 63.94.
Starting with 5, we check if 4087 is divisible by 5. The last digit of 4087 is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
Next, we can check 4087 against prime numbers 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, and 61, all of which are less than 63.
After checking all these prime numbers, we can conclude that 4087 is not divisible by any of them.
Therefore, 4087 only has factors of 1 and itself and is a prime number.
###
Yes, 4087 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 4087 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we can check for divisibility by numbers in the range 2 to √4087. 

However, we can also use a primality test to simplify the process. One commonly used primality test is to check for divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of the given number.

So, let's start by checking divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 4087:

√4087 ≈ 63.89

Let's check for divisibility by primes up to 63:

2 does not divide 4087
3 does not divide 4087
5 does not divide 4087
7 divides 4087 (since 7 * 584 = 4088, which is not equal to 4087)
11 does not divide 4087
13 does not divide 4087
17 does not divide 4087
19 does not divide 4087
23 does not divide 4087
29 does not divide 4087
31 divides 4087 (31 * 132 = 4087)

Since we have found two factors of 4087 (7 and 31) other than 1 and itself, 4087 is a composite number.

9211 ÷ 2 = 4605.5 (not a whole number)
9211 ÷ 3 = 3070.333 (not a whole number)
9211 ÷ 5 = 1842.2 (not a whole number)
...
9211 ÷ 95 ≈ 97.168 (not a whole number)

Since 9211 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root, we can conclude that 9211 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 9211 is a composite number.
###
To determine if 9211 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any factors besides 1 and itself.

No, 9727 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 9727 is a prime number, we can use a few strategies. One way is to check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

Let's start by finding the square root of 9727, which is approximately 98.62 (rounded to two decimal places). We now need to check if 9727 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 98.

First, we check if it is divisible by 2. Since 9727 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check if it is divisible by 3. Adding the digits of 9727, we get 9 + 7 + 2 + 7 = 25, which is not divisible by 3. Thus, 9727 is not divisible by 3.

Continuing this process, we can check if it is divisible by 5. The last digit of 9727 is 7, so it is not divisible by 5.

Finally, we check if it is divisible by any prime numbers in the range of 7 to 97 (excluding 5). Through this process, we find that 9727 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 97.

Therefore, 9727 is a prime number.
